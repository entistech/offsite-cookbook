    "# How to stream completions\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you request a completion from the OpenAI, the entire completion is generated before being sent back in a single response.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get responses sooner, you can 'stream' the completion as it's being generated. This allows you to start printing or processing the beginning of the completion before the full completion is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stream completions, set `stream=True` when calling the chat completions or completions endpoints. This will return an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format). Extract chunks from the `delta` field rather than the `message` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsides\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using `stream=True` in a production application makes it more difficult to moderate the content of the completions, as partial completions may be more difficult to evaluate. which has implications for [approved usage](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another small drawback of streaming responses is that the response no longer includes the `usage` field to tell you how many tokens were consumed. After receiving and combining all of the responses, you can calculate this yourself using [`tiktoken`](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example code\n",

    "Below, this notebook shows:\n",

    "2. What a streaming chat completion response looks like\n",
    "3. How much time is saved by streaming a chat completion\n",
    "4. How to stream non-chat completions (used by older models like `text-davinci-003`)"
