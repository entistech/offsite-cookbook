Thanks to the perfect alignment between the Board of Directors and the management, and to the agility and the talents ofthe teams, we were faster and strongerthan imagined by all observers.

Renault Group

Despite the intensification of the crises, the year 2022 was marked for Renault Group by an impressive momentum, which confirms the relevance of our strategy: focus on value, a conscious choice to intensify our activities in France, acceleration of our electric transition, looking for new sources

of growth, such as the circular economy and mobility services. The presentation of our future vehicles at the Paris Motor Show, the renewable electricity supply contract, the ramping up of our strategic partnerships, the label of excellence obtained by the Refactory Campus and the announcement of the reorganization of the Group were some of the highlights of the year, topped off by financial results that exceeded expectations.

For these remarkable achievements, I would like to give my warm thanks and congratulations to the Group’s teams, led with the exceptional energy and talent of Luca de Meo, bandmaster of a company that is playing louder and louder, more and more in tune, faster and faster!

When the strategy is clear, when the momentum is strong, risks and hazards can be tackled more

effectively. has

The company demonstrated this in the face of various crises that have been prolonged (semiconductors, supply, war in Ukraine) or intensified (inflation, energy crisis).

The early weeks of 2023 suggest that these difficult conditions will continue. Our resilience and solidarity will be called upon again. I know I can count on the remarkable work of the board of directors, which Luca now joins, as well as on the commitment and confidence of the teams in the Group’s orientations, as evidenced by the recent success of the employee shareholding plan. We will also be driven by the acceleration of our strategic plan. Finally, we will benefit from the new momentum of our Alliance. The agreement we announced on February 6, allows us to open a new chapter on solid foundations. Going forward, hidden agendas and mutual frustrations are a thing of the past, giving way to a reinvigorated Alliance focused on concrete projects offering very high added value.

Four years ago, I agreed to take over the presidency of Renault, in a context of unprecedented economic, political and geopolitical chaos.

In 2019, the priority was to take emergency measures and avoid the implosion and bankruptcy of Renault Group and the Alliance; in 2020, we had to resist and rebuild the fundamentals; in 2021, it was recovery and reconquest; in 2022, the company amplified the strength of its rebound. As I complete my first term as President and Chief Executive Officer of Renault, I am driven by a dual feeling of pride and gratitude. I would like to express my deepest thanks to the Board of Directors, who worked with remarkable quality and intensity throughout these years, as well as to the Group’s teams, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting regularly and who have always given me their warm support. Thanks to the perfect alignment between the board of directors and the management, thanks to the agility and the talents of the teams, we were faster and stronger than imagined by all observers.

On December 15, the Board of Directors proposed my reappointment. If the shareholders approve this proposal at our next AGM on May 11, I will be keen to continue working to ensure that the Group completes its impressive recovery, at the forefront of a fair and sustainable mobility industry.

Renault Group

The announcement on November 8 of the Group’s transformation into a next-generation automotive company opens a new stage. Our new frontier is to add to this culture ofresilience the mindset of a company that now intends to race ahead.

The year 2022 confirmed all the hopes that the Renaulution plan had raised and even more! After such an existential crisis which had not been experienced for almost 40 years, Renault Group is now out of the woods. This year we completed the restructuring phase of our plan – the Resurrection – almost three years ahead of schedule. With an operating margin of 5.6%, compared with a negative margin only two years ago, we are already achieving the target for 2025. The Group has generated €3.4 billion in free cash flow since 2021, which is already more than we expected by 2023.

Few examples of such a rapid turnaround could be found throughout the automotive industry. This result was achieved in a particularly difficult context marked by the continuing semiconductor crisis, disruptions in global supply chains, the conflict in Ukraine and the generalized inflation which weighs particularly heavily on energy and raw materials. This is the best proof that the fundamentals of the Group have been thoroughly cleaned up, thanks to the reduction of our fixed and variable costs but also thanks to the adoption of a commercial policy centered on value. One indicator reveals, better than any other, the depth of the work accomplished: with a 50% drop in incidents over the first months of 2022, Renault has now reached unprecedented levels of quality, which places it at the reference in the sector, in Europe.

The second phase of the plan, Renovation, which focuses on the product, is largely underway. It is no exaggeration to say that Renault is on the eve of having the best range it has had in 30 years. Of the launches made between 2022 and 2025, 50% will concern vehicles in the C segments and above. Nearly 50% will be electric vehicles. The past year has shown the beginnings of this wave that will carry the Group in the years to come. The launches of Megane and Austral were major commercial successes, while the Group’s presence at the Motor Show in October, with no fewer than six launches, symbolized Renault’s return.

The announcement on November 8, of the Group’s transformation into a next-generation automotive company opens a new stage. We see in the forced transformations that the automobile is undergoing today as well as in the rapid evolution of the technological landscape a unique opportunity to make a new start by adapting the company to the reality of a playing field that is disrupting routines established for decades. A next-generation company, Renault will be able to excel equally in traditional activities – linked to combustion engines and hybrids – and in new activities, from electricity and software to circular economy, to new mobility services.

The financial implications of this transformation are major. Today, Renault achieves approximately 25% of its turnover in activities with either growth or a margin of more than 10%. In 2030, it will achieve 45% in activities whose growth and margin will show such a performance. At that time,the Group itself will show a double-digit margin.

The challenge in 2023 is to roll out this metamorphosis. Renault no longer has to prove its ability to weather storms. Our new frontier is to add to this culture of resilience the mindset of a company that now intends to race ahead. As we have seen in recent months, impossible is not Renault!

Strategic Plan

From volume to value creation

A plan structured in three phases that are launched in parallel, which will restore competitiveness by:

● improving the efficiency of functional divisions thanks to strict cost control;

● taking advantage of the Group’s industrial strengths and position as leader in electric vehicles throughout Europe;

● drawing on the Alliance’s technological expertise to boost efficiency;

● exploring even further into the world of data, mobility and energy services;

● relying on 5 businesses specializing in new value chains to become a next-generation automotive group. This organization will be effective from 2023.

Resurrection Through 2023 Phase one: become competitive once again by reducing costs and generating profit. Achieved.

Renovation Through 2025 Phase two: renew and enrich our line-ups, feeding brand profitability.

Revolution As of 2022

Phase three: enter resources into the value chains emerging from the transformation of the automotive and mobility industry.

The Resurrection phase of our plan is over.

This year, Renault Group met the profitability target initially setfor 2025.

8-9% since 2021

Renovation:

The Renovation phase, which is linked to the launch of a new products range on the market, is now well under way.

Renault Group will launch 25 new vehicles to market between 2022 and 2025, in the most profitable and relevant segments: 50% of these launches will be in the C-segment and above, 50% will be 100% electric vehicles.

Revolution:

Significantly ahead of its initial objectives, Renault Group began the third chapter of the Renaulution plan at the end of 2022 : the Revolution.

The guiding principles of this value and ecosystem-based approach are:

● Strategic focus;

● Efficiency;

● Optimised capital allocation;

● Selection of the best partners;

● "Asset-light"(1) by design.

Renault Group is enacting its own Revolution by creating five targeted businesses, with specialized teams ; each business is built on a homogeneous set of technologies, with its own governance and its own profit and loss account.

These businesses are:

● Ampere: the first electric and software pure player born out of the transformation of a traditional car manufacturer;

● Alpine: an exclusive, zero-emission and global brand with motor racing in its DNA. A unique asset-light model, combined with proprietary technologies;

● Mobilize: built around a leading captive-finance company to target the new-mobility, energy and data-services markets;

● THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL: the automotive industry's first

company dedicated to the circular economy: from the closed loop of materials to battery recycling;

● Power: Renault Group's traditional core business will continue to develop innovative, low-emission internal combustion and hybrid vehicles under the Renault, Dacia and Renault LCV brands, each with its own dedicated organization and governance.

The Renaulution plan ushers in a new era for the Group. It will ensure the company's sustainable profitability and its commitment to be carbon neutral in Europe by 2040 and in the world by 2050. Our ambition:to build the next generation automotive company.

1.1.2 Strategy and objectives

01

Following the approval by the Board of Directors, chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard, at its meeting on November 7, 2022, Luca de Meo, CEO of Renault Group and Thierry Piéton, CFO of Renault Group, presented the third chapter of the "Renaulution" strategy on November 8, on the occasion ofthe Capital Market Day.

Until now,

car manufacturers have operated in an environment characterised by mature combustion-engine technology and stable customer expectations. Current changes reshaping the automotive industry are leading to the emergence of new value chains: electric vehicles (EV), software, new mobility services and the circular economy. Today, after Resurrection and Renovation, the first two phases of the Renaulution strategic plan presented on January 14, 2021, Renault Group begins the third chapter and launches its Revolution with the ambition of

becoming a next generation automotive group.

This new organization, which will be implemented gradually from 2023, will enable Renault Group to draw value from all the new profit pools (estimated by external sources at around €220 billion in 2030, compared with €110 billion today). To seize opportunities in these markets and to adapt to the current environment, Renault Group is creating dedicated organizations. It will transform its business portfolio by exploiting value chains that are structurally more profitable. Renault Group will leverage a horizontal and ecosystem approach to co-create, co-finance and scale up strategic initiatives with leadingpartners.

The five Businesses

These five businesses are the following:

1. Power: innovative low-emission internal-combustion and hybrid vehicles

Internal combustion and hybrid vehicles will still account for up to 50% of global passenger car sales even by 2040. The development of efficient technologies in this area is essential for the future of any global car manufacturer. This is why Renault Group is keen to develop its core business, with the launch of an all-new range for Renault ICE & Hybrid (passenger cars), Dacia and LCV - and with the creation of a world-leading supplier of internal combustion and hybrid engine technologies.

Renault Group will combine its internal combustion engine and hybrid technologies (Horse project) with Geely to create a world-class automotive manufacturer

Renault Group and Geely will combine their internal combustion engines in a 50/50 entity. This dedicated business will design, develop, produce sell

and components and systems for internal combustion and hybrid engines with advanced technologies. From day one, this entity will generate a turnover of over 15 billion euros with a volume of 5 million units per year. It already has 8 customers who

will

benefit from increased productivity and synergies.

This fully-fledged entity will have a global presence and activity with:

● 17 plants to supply 130 markets;

● 5 R&D centers in Europe (Spain, Romania and Sweden), China and South America, comprising a total of 3,000 engineers;

● 19,000 employees, in total, on 3 continents.

This

entity will offer

a comprehensive

range of technologies for all

components: engine, gearbox, hybridization system (xHEV) and batteries, at the highest level. Through this project, Renault Group will double its size and grow its market coverage from 40% to 80% worldwide. Such growth is driven by geographic expansion with access to North America and China and by product complementarity, thank to which complete low-emission solutions and systems will be offered to car manufacturers. To achieve this, this entity will develop its technology offering in the field of alternative fuels through a strategic cooperation with a potential partner from the energy industry.

Renault ICE & Hybrid: global premiumisation

Despite the steep rise in the EV offer, internal-combustion vehicles will continue to grow, particularly outside Europe. The Renault brand will therefore continue to be present in the internal-combustion and hybrid-vehicle markets, particularly in Latin America, India, South Korea and North Africa. Sales of Renault ICE & Hybrid passenger vehicles will continue to grow by an average of 2% per year over the period 2022-2030.

To move upmarket in all regions, Renault will continue its offensive in the C-segment and between 2022 and 2030 will increase net income by 20% and the margin on variable costs by 30%.

Dacia: from an operating margin of over 10% to 15% in 2030

The Dacia model is unique and based on the winning combination of three main components:

● design-to-cost engineering (cost efficiency) already providing a solid double-digit cost benefit;

● an industrial and supply base with a benchmark cost competitiveness;

● an asset-light distribution model ensuring a cost level comparable to the agency model;

● 85% sales mix to private customers.

As a result, Dacia already generates an operating margin of over 10% and aims to reach 15% in 2030.

To fulfill this goal, Dacia, currently the leader in the B-segment, will boldly set its sights on the C-segment. After Jogger this year, Bigster will embody this move into the C-segment, with two other vehicles to follow, doubling its profit pool coverage.

At the same time, Dacia will continue to reduce its costs and will benefit from the doubling of volumes on the

global CMF-B platform, which will reach (all brands combined) 2 million units by 2030.

Dacia will contribute to the reinvention of the internal- combustion value chain through cooperation with the

Horse project by developing disruptive powertrains adapted for alternative and synthetic fuels. Dacia will gradually electrify its range in Europe by pioneering the deployment of accessible electric solutions.

LCV business: propelled into the future by 2 disruptive projects

Renault Group's LCV (light commercial vehicle) business is built on solid foundations with a European fleet of over 5 million vehicles, an ecosystem of over 600 Pro+ dealers, four plants and the latest range that will be launched in around 2026.

Renault LCV will develop two disruptive projects to respond to a dynamic and changing market:

● Hyvia: Renault Group's joint venture with Plug Power, for mobility with decarbonized hydrogen, which offers solutions covering all needs, from fuel cell vehicles to hydrogen refueling and electrolysis. Hyvia combines Plug Power's hydrogen expertise with the industrial and engineering assets of Renault Group. Hyvia aims to have a 30% of the hydrogen LCV market in 2030 in Europe and a cumulative order book of 1 billion euros by 2026;

● FlexEVan: a family of electric, commercial vehicles defined around revolutionary software, which will be launched as of 2026. FlexEVan will be compact for city use thanks to a specially designed electric platform. FlexEVan will benefit from the SDV (Software-Defined Vehicle) developed within Ampere. The vehicle will become a fully connected extension of the warehouse and integrated in the customer's digital ecosystem. It will be the first vehicle to benefit from the application of Renault Group's SDV technology, including real-time end-to-end operations monitoring and data-driven fleet management. FlexEVan will reduce the total lifetime cost of ownership by at least 30% for customers, more than the of the

Through this partnership, development costs will be shared, allowing for a significant reduction in costs and customer coverage will be maximized.

vehicle. To support

2. Ampere: the first electric and software pure player born out of the disruption of a traditional car manufacturer

With Ampere, Renault Group creates an autonomous entity that will be the first electric and software pure player born out of the disruption of a traditional car manufacturer. Ampere will develop, manufacture and sell all-electric cars with advanced passenger SDV technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will combine the best of both worlds: the know-how and assets of Renault Group with the focus and agility of a 100% electric player.

Based in France, Ampere will be a fully-fledged car manufacturer with approximately 10,000 employees. As a technology company, Ampere will favour innovation with

22

approximately 3,500 engineers, half of whom specialize in software.

By 2030, Ampere's range of six electric vehicles will be ideally positioned in the most dynamic segments in Europe covering 80% of the generalists' electric market: in the B-segment with the new Renault 5 Electric and Renault 4 Electric and in the C-segment with Megane E-Tech Electric, Scenic Electric and two other vehicles that are still to come. A large part of the investment for the first four vehicles has already been spent.

Ampere aims to make around 1 million electric vehicles for the Renault brand in 2031. Ampere is set to grow, with a compound annual growth rate of more than 30% over the next 10 years.

Ampere is based on three technological pillars that make it unique in the electric vehicle and software ecosystem:

● A high-tech and competitive industrial base: ElectriCity is already one of the largest and most competitive electric-vehicle manufacturing hubs in Europe. In 2025, it will turn out one vehicle in less than 10 hours. With a production capacity of 400,000 units from day one, it will be able to produce up to 1 million vehicles by relying on other Renault Group facilities. ElectriCity also offers a unique local ecosystem with 80% of suppliers located within a radius of 300 kilometers;

● An European electric-vehicle value chain: Ampere works with the most relevant players to access know-how, ensure sustainable supplies and gain clarity and control over costs and performance. Through its European supply chain, Ampere will procure the more than 80 GWh of power needed for its vehicles by 2030. From covering 10% of the electric-vehicle value chain in 2020, it now covers more than 30% and will reach 80% by 2030;

● Revolutionary Software-Defined

Vehicle

(SDV) technology: SDV is the future of the automotive industry it enables a vehicle to

as be constantly updated throughout its life cycle, while learning from its users and remaining in contact with the manufacturer, from design until end of life. To launch its first open and horizontal SDV in 2026, Renault Group has built strong partnerships with two major tech player;

- Qualcomm Technologies,

to co-develop high- performance computing on platforms based Snapdragon® Digital Chassis™ solutions for the Centralized Electronic Architecture. This includes the System-on-Chip (SoC) and the bottom layers of the software, as well as functionalities, on-board services and applications. Qualcomm Technologies, or one of its subsidiaries, intends to invest in Renault Group's electric and software entity, Ampere;

- Google, to create an Android platform for the Software-Defined Vehicle, as well as a Cloud system to store the digital twin.

No other company in the industry intends to build an SDV using a horizontal approach. This approach reduces development time and costs. The partnership with Google, to create the open Android platform, allows Ampere to tap into one of the largest global ecosystems of independent application developers. They will create a

variety of services that will enrich the customer's experience, while accelerating the development of functionalities throughout the vehicle's life cycle.

These partnerships will enable Renault Group to reduce costs and improve efficiency, flexibility and speed during the development of vehicles. In addition, the value for users will increase to continuous thanks software innovation and regular updates.

3. Alpine: an exclusive, zero-emission and global brand with motor racing in its DNA

Over the past two years, Alpine has undergone a renaissance, capitalising on its iconic A110 sports coupé and its entry into Formula 1, where it aims to become a contender. Today, Alpine is a truly exclusive brand, a fully- fledged, asset-light, technology-focused manufacturer with a team of 2,000 people, 50% of whom are engineers. Being part of the Group gives Alpine access to Ampere's electric and software technology assets. In the future, Alpine will rely on business partnerships and investor support to accelerate its growth and international expansion.

Alpine is developing a brand-new range that will support its growth and international ambitions and will be all- electric as from 2026. In the meantime, Alpine will unveil the next A110 and two new models: a B-segment sedan and a C+ segment crossover. Alpine plans to launch two vehicles equipped with advanced technology in the D- and E-segments to support its international expansion: half of Alpine's growth will come from new markets outside Europe, potentially including North America and China.

4. Mobilize: built

around a leading captive-finance company to target the new-mobility, energy and data- services markets

Mobilize is built around one key asset, Mobilize Financial Services (Mobilize F.S.), one of the best captive-finance companies in the market with 4 million customers. Mobilize F.S. will expand its traditional business activities while developing new activities such as subscription, insurance and operational leasing.

Mobilize is poised to become a leading and profitable, dedicated Vehicle-as-a-Service (VaaS) provider, combining financial, mobility, energy and data services

supported by purpose-built vehicles. These services, combined in a single solution, will meet the needs of private customers, fleets and mobility operators while generating recurring income. What differentiates Mobilize from any other car brand is that it provides services for the product and not the other way around. Thanks to the VaaS model, Mobilize will generate three times more income over the entire life cycle of the vehicle, in comparison with traditional sales.

5. THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL: the automotive industry's first company dedicated to the circular economy: from the closed loop of materials to battery recycling

To confirm its commitment to the circular economy and make progress on the path of resource neutrality, Renault Group announced on 13 October 2022, the creation of a new entity: THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL. By bringing together all the existing expertise of the Group and its partners in this activity, the new entity offers closed-loop recycling solutions at every stage of a vehicle's life: supply of parts and raw materials, production, use and end of life. THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL currently covers about 50% of the value chain and is aiming for over 90% by 2030. This entity is set to become the European leader in the closed-loop automotive circular economy, on an industrial scale. It will serve Renault Group and the entire industry. In order to accelerate its development and strengthen its leadership, THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL is making a minority of its capital available to external investors with the aim of co-financing investments of around

€500 million until 2030.

ESG (Environment, Social, Governance): a performance lever for Renault Group

The Group's Revolution will see an acceleration of its ESG trajectory, which represents a key lever for the Group's operational and financial performance.

The re-engineering of Renault Group's business will enable it to become a forerunner in the quest for carbon neutrality and an inclusive future.

Regarding the climate, the Group aims to be carbon neutral in Europe by 2040 and in the world by 2050, by taking a cradle-to-grave approach. The Group has set interim carbon-footprint reduction targets to mark its path, with specific action plans for each of its activities.

chain in 2030

In keeping with its tradition of corporate responsibility, Renault Group will support the transition by upskilling and training thousands of people to enter the new value chains of the automotive revolution. For example, with ReKnow University, which is open to the entire industry, 15,000 Renault Group employees and 4,500 students and suppliers will be trained by 2025 in the future skills needed by the automotive industry, in electric mobility, the circular economy, software, cybersecurity and data.

Financial outlook

Renault Group's new organization, based on the five businesses, will be directly reflected in its financial reporting to foster

simplicity, and transparency, both

accountability internally and externally. performance of these five businesses will continue to be underpinned by the financial discipline introduced during the Resurrection phase. The Group's levers - a policy focused on

The

value rather than volume, improved competitiveness and capital efficiency - will be further accelerated through its new-product offensive, a strong emphasis on variable costs, the development of a

sustainable supplier network and digitalisation, respectively. In addition, an ecosystem approach to partnerships, which is unique, will allow the Group to extend its coverage of key value chains with a low capital commitment.

To meet the challenge posed by the unprecedented transformation of

the industry, Renault Group has adopted an approach based on two principles: a self-financing plan, secured by the extensive generation of free cash flow from its operations;

●

● partnerships or external finance to accelerate growth, innovation or competitiveness and to reduce capital requirements.

24

Ampere: low cash consumption & external financing

Renault Group wishes to accelerate the future development of Ampere and propel the Renault brand towards an electric future by mobilising the Group's financial resources in a disciplined manner. In this context, the Group plans to call on external partners and investors to participate in this adventure with the following assumptions:

● established electric-vehicle player with consumption. Free cash flow above 0 in 2025;

low

cash

● open to external investors to accelerate R&D and the development of the ecosystem;

● Alliance (Renault Group, Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors): capital participation under consideration;

● initial Public Offering on Euronext Paris envisaged at the earliest in the second half of 2023 (subject to market conditions) with Renault Group retaining a strong majority and the support of potential strategic investors (including Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.).

Horse project: financially optimising the future of internal-combustion and hybrid engines

From a financial perspective, the Horse project aims to generate productivity gains, reduce fixed costs and significantly improve the Group's financial position. Renault Group should retain 50% of the capital of this entity and, as a result, will separate this activity from Renault Group's scope and financial statements as from the second half of 2023.

The impact of this carve-out is estimated as follows:

● €2.5 billion reduction in fixed assets;

● €1.2 billion in fixed-cost variabilization per year on average and €2.4 billion reduction in Capex and R&D, from 2023 to 2030;

● cost competitiveness of engines: €2.5 billion between 2023 and 2030. Positive impact as from 2024;

● dividend corresponding to the share of capital retained by Renault Group;

● future potential capital gain.

Financial outlook of Renault Group

Renault Group aims to fulfil the following objectives:

● an operating margin of more than 8% in 2025 and more than 10% in 2030;

● free cash flow of more than €2 billion per year on average over 2023-2025 and more than €3 billion per year on average over 2026-2030;

● free cash flow will include a Mobilize Financial Services dividend expected to be over €500 million per year on average, subject to approval from regulators and the Mobilize F.S. Board of Directors;

● R&D and Capex: maximum of 8% of revenues over 2022-2030;

● ROCE (Return

On Capital Employed): above 30%

from 2025;

In addition, Renault Group has exceeded its financial objectives for the year 2022:

● Renault Group operating margin of over 5%;

● automotive operating free cash flow of more than €1.5 billion.

Restoring the dividend

Renault Group plans to reinstate the payment of a dividend as from 2023 (based on the 2022 financial year, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting). This

dividend symbolises a new era. The pay-out ratio will increase gradually and in a disciplined manner to 35% of net income - Group share, in the medium term. To do so, the Group will have to fulfil its first priority, which is to return to an investment grade financial rating.

Capital allocation policy

Renault Group plans to reinvest at least 50% of the surplus cash generated within the Group. In the future, Renault Group would like to be more active in financial investments, in line with its ecosystem approach, but limiting them to a maximum of 15% to 20% of its free cash flow.

For the allocation of the remaining cash and separate from the dividend, the Group wishes to involve employees in its performance in order to foster a common sense of belonging to the project and to nurture a value culture. Through dedicated employee share-ownership plans, the Group aims to increase employee share ownership to 10% of capital by 2030.

Existing bonds will remain under the name, Renault S.A., which is the issuer for the Group's industrial activities. Each business will be able to use financing instruments according to its own needs and strategy.

Renault: an ingenious “tech“ and modern “pop“ brand

For more than 120 years, Renault has been the ingenious, popular and modern French automotive brand

contributing to social and societal progress.

Renault has constantly innovated to improve the mobility of all individuals and professionals by devising creative solutions adapted to modern life. Bold in its offer, attentive to people, upbeat and brimming with life, the Renault brand has been inventing the future of mobility.

Synonymous with progress, Renault cars have become icons, like Renault 4 and Renault 5, cult vehicles from the 70s and 80s.

Since 2010, Renault has been a pioneer in electric vehicles.

The year 2022 was marked by the major launch of Megane E-Tech Electric (100% electric technology) and Austral (second generation full-hybrid E-Tech technology).

Today, Renault continues to innovate on the latest generation of the “Cars for life and for living“ concept that it has invented, for an ever more welcoming, intuitively intelligent, warm and safe experience.

Involved in the challenges of its time, the Renault brand is committed to the development of the electric mobility ecosystem. It uses a circular vision to consider the recyclability of the product, from its design and over its entire life cycle.

In 2022, Renault also continued its internationalization in Latin America with the launch of Kwid phase 2 in all markets and the launch of Kwid E-Tech Electric in Brazil, where the HR13 Turbo engine was also introduced on the new Duster,to the public's delight.

In India, the promotion of the Renault range was based on "model year" promotions on Kwid, Triber and Kiger.

With Renault E-Tech, pioneer and leader in the electric vehicle market, Renault is continuing its product offensive

Since 2010, Renault, a pioneer in electric vehicles, has been one of the major players in electric mobility in Europe.

Thanks to its Formula 1 innovation laboratory, Renault has developed its E-Tech hybrid powertrain, protected by 150 patents.

Renault E-Tech includes all Renault vehicles able to run on electric traction and have an electric motor. There are hybrid models, plug-in hybrids and 100% electric vehicles.

The E-Tech technology was first used on the Renault brand’s Best Sellers and is now being used on new models as soon as they are launched.

Across the brand, electric-powered E-Tech vehicles, all technologies combined, represented 51% of private sales in 2022 in Europe.

Since its launch, with more than 400,000 units, Zoe is one of the best-selling electric vehicle in Europe.

Today, it is an electric revolution that is picking up pace. A dynamic supported by Luca de Meo's “Renaulution“ strategic plan. A new era where all Renault brand electric vehicles will be popular and generate value.

To continue the story of its electric revolution, Renault launched the first model of its “generation 2.0“ electric vehicles: All-New Megane E-Tech Electric.

All-New Megane E-Tech Electric is both an emotional and

a technological breakthrough in Renault's core range. Connected and integrated into the EV ecosystem and the digital ecosystem of its users, it allows Renault to continue its history as the creator of the “Cars for life and for living“.

Sporting Renault's new “Nouvel’R“ logo, All-New Megane E-Tech Electric embodies the brand's transformation.

To cater to its customers, Renault continues to enhance its vehicles with innovative connected services.

The “technical minute“ on E-Tech hybrid :

Hybrid vehicles are equipped with five main components :

● the multi-mode, clutchless smart gearbox resulting from our Formula 1 experience has been developed to reduce energy losses. It has a total of 15 modes: three for electric and five for thermal, which can work together or not. It offers a strong acceleration capacity, intensity in mid-range acceleration and reduced consumption and CO2 emissions;

● an e-engine, the main electric motor, which starts the vehicle, ensures 100% electric driving, drives the wheels and allows the battery to be recharged;

● a secondary electric motor that acts as a starter and high-voltage generator for the petrol engine. It also acts as a battery regenerator during hybrid driving and as a gear shift stabilizer to avoid jolts and vibrations;

● a battery that stores the energy necessary for vehicle travel and then ensures the autonomy of the vehicle in electric mode (battery size on the second-generation Austral E-Tech full hybrid = 2 kWh);

● a combustion engine specially designed to reduce consumption and CO2 emissions. It is equipped with a particulate filter and combines economy, efficiency and performance.

These features allow the E-Tech hybrid version to run in 100% electric mode for up to 80% of city driving time.

Renault’s strategy to reconquest the C-segment:

The C-segment is at the heart of the Renaulution strategic plan. Renault has mobilized to win background in the market's most profitable segment. Arkana began the offensive and has been very successful since its launch in March 2021. the offensive in

Renault continues this category with All-New Megane E-Tech Electric and strengthened its position in 2022 with Austral.

Austral:

Renault refreshes its offering in the C-SUV category with a particularly ambitious product Austral. This Renaulution family SUV combines the look of an SUV with comfort worthy of the family minivans that have helped shape the history of Renault. Its elegant design is spiced up by an “Esprit Alpine“ finish, a first for Renault. This version offers special design aspects that are inspired by the world of the Alpine brand and are particularly dynamic and attractive.

From a technical perspective, Austral is the first Renault vehicle designed on the CMF–CD3 platform jointly developed within the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. It benefits from a fully electric engine range, including two mild-hybrid units with 12v or 48v hybridization and a new generation of the E-Tech Hybrid system, developing up to 200 hp with a very low level of consumption and of CO2 emissions (from 104 g/km and 4.6 l/100 km).

Austral’s generous cabin space also offers an enhanced driving experience thanks to high-tech equipment. The openR® HMI* brings together data from the instrument panel with the openRlink® multimedia system all within the same unit. Its two 12-inch large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented, technological on-board experience, in addition to the head-up display system on the windscreen. The openRlink® multimedia system offers Google services. The 32 driver assistance systems provide peace of mind and safety for the driver and the passengers.

Megane E-Tech Electric:

Renault and electric vehicles represent 10 years of unparalleled experience and expertise, as shown by the 10 billion “e-kilometers“ already covered by more than 500,000 vehicles sold around the world. Renault Group, an EV pioneer, is continuing its story with a product plan that targets the core market.

This strategy is embodied in the Renault range with Megane E-Tech Electric, which heralds the extension of Renault's 100% electric range into the C-segment, the automotive market's largest segment.

This sleek and elegantly styled sedan exceeds expectations. Thanks to the Alliance-developed CMF-EV platform, it rewrites the rulebook and pushes the boundaries in terms of design, footprint/spaciousness ratio and versatility. The platform fully dedicated to electric vehicles also brings exceptional energy efficiency to Megane E-Tech Electric, which has a range of up to 470 km (WLTP).

Megane E-Tech Electric symbolizes the reinvention of the core market, representing a leap forward in all aspects. It provides unparalleled driving pleasure. It features the all- new openR® HMI*, which merges dashboard data with the openRlink® multimedia system. Its two 12-inch large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented, technological on-board experience.

*HMI = Human-Machine Interface

Megane E-Tech Electric is the first model to be 100% “Made in ElectriCity“, Renault Group's new industrial hub and European leader of electric vehicles located in the north of France.

Megane E-Tech made its commercial debut in July 2022 and has already sold 32,000 units in Europe, with a very high proportion of top-of-the-range finishes, thereby testifying to Renault’s return to the premium segment. It been

has acclaimed by the European press for its dynamism, comfort and efficiency, not to mention its presentation and finish.

Arkana:

By launching its sporty Arkana SUV in Europe in the spring of 2021, Renault has shaken up traditional market codes. It has become the first generalist manufacturer to offer a coupé SUV in Europe, this segment having so far been the prerogative of premium brands.

This new offering, which complements the other models in the compact range, is in line with a very fast-growing global SUV market – particularly in the C-segment. It is a precursor to the renewal of

the C-segment in the “Renaulution“ plan.

Arkana offers a range of multiple hybrid engines integrating the innovative 145 hp E-Tech hybrid engine and its 1.3 TCe 12v mild-hybrid engines in 140 hp and 160 hp (since October 2021) versions. Arkana, which started the offensive in the C-segment, has been very successful: more than 82,000 units were sold in Europe in 2022.

These volumes expand on those already achieved in South Korea with approximately 20,000 units in 2022, where the model is marketed under the name XM3.

O 1 Renault Group

General presentation of Renault Group

Dacia, the brand that constantly redefines the essentials

Founded in 1968 and launched in 2004 throughout Europe and the Mediterranean basin, Dacia has always offered cars

that offer the best value for money, constantly redefining what is essential. A disruptive brand, Dacia designs vehicles that are simple, versatile, reliable and in tune with its customers' lifestyles. Dacia's models have become market benchmarks: Sandero, the best-selling car in Europe; Duster, the most affordable SUV; Jogger, the 5- or 7-seat family model; and Spring, Europe's champion of accessible electric mobility. Dacia is a Renault Group brand, present in 44 countries. Since 2004, it has sold over 8 million vehicles.

In 1999, guided by Louis Schweitzer, Dacia joined Renault Group and opened up to new ambitions.

This turning point in the brand’s history came in 2004 with the launch of Logan, a modern, robust and, above all, affordable family sedan. Initially designed for emerging markets, at an unbeatable price of 5,000 euros, it was a great commercial success, including in Western Europe, where it went on sale in 2005. A new vehicle at a second- hand price, it was a revolution in the automotive market.

2008 saw the arrival of the Sandero, Dacia’s second major launch under Renault Group. It also proved to be its biggest commercial success. Its many advantages – an interior volume worthy of a higher segment, a practical, versatile spirit and an affordable price – have made it the top-selling carfor individuals in Europe since 2017.

In 2010, Dacia launched the Duster, an attractive vehicle with true off-road capabilities. It was once again a commercial success, selling more than two million units worldwide.

In 2021, the brand revealed Spring, the brand's first electric model, which is the most affordable on the European

market. In 2022, Spring is the third vehicle sold to individuals in Europe.

The latest addition to the range, Dacia Jogger, reinvents the family car. As either a 5- or 7-seater, Jogger perfectly embodies Dacia’s positioning and spirit. With versatility thanks to its record levels of space and modularity and an attractive, rugged design, Jogger is made for adventure. This model reinforces Dacia’s commitment to making mobility accessible to all: a sustainable mobility since it will soon be offered with a hybrid engine. Jogger is the ideal companion for all daily activities or family recreation.

Dacia thus offers a complete range of light vehicles equipped with efficient engines based on Renault Group’s proven technology. Dacia is the European leader in this field, offering dual-fuel vehicles (LPG and petrol) across its entire range.

Dacia today and tomorrow: Dacia will always

be Dacia

Dacia continues to write its own script, without ever forgetting what has made it a success: the guarantee of unbeatable value for money on all its vehicles.

42

From design to sales, manufacturing and transport, the brand remains faithful to its strategy of optimizing costs at every step so that its customers pay only for what they need.

In 2022, Dacia

started marketing Jogger, the new 5-7-seater wagon available since March. This model takes up the best of each category: the length of a station wagon, the roominess of a MPV and the attributes of an SUV.

From 2023, Dacia will offer its first model with a hybrid version on Jogger: the Hybrid 140 engine developing 140 hp. This technology, mastered within the Renault Group, once again allows Dacia to benefit from proven technical components.

And Dacia will complete the engine range of its Spring electric city car with the arrival of the Electric 65 engine.

In June 2022, Dacia's new visual identity was revealed for all of the brand's vehicles. New Dacia Link emblem, new logotype, new colors… but still the same essentiality.

After the communication media, including digital (mid- 2021) and the dealer network, which began to change at the start of 2022, it is the turn of the vehicles to adopt the brand's new identity. Beyond the design changes, this new identity also carries commitments for the future, while capitalizing on the strong values that have made Dacia so successful.

In September 2022, Dacia revealed Manifesto: a concept car that concentrates and reaffirms the brand's values. This essential and cool vehicle is intended for outdoor use, economically and ecologically efficient. It is a laboratory of ideas from which certain innovations will benefit future production models.

The Manifesto concept respects the fundamentals of the Outdoor with a 4-wheel transmission, very generous ground clearance associated with large wheels and a bodywork resistant to the most difficult terrain. With the Manifesto concept, the brand offers a vision of a vehicle that reduces its environmental footprint to a minimum. Compact and lightweight, it limits

its energy consumption.

This year, Dacia is reaffirming its 3 brand values:

● Essential but cool

Dacia is ingenious, creative, attractive, with innovations such as Media Control and modular roof bars. This is also true in terms of design, with a cool look… and at no extra cost.

● Robust and outdoor

Reliability and sturdiness are among the attributes on which Dacia has built its success. These attributes make Dacia ideal cars for outdoor activities.

● Eco-smart – economical and ecological

Dacia is committed to reconciling individual interests with those of society as a whole. Eliminating the superfluous thus reduces weight and therefore saves fuel and emits less CO2.

Launched in the spring of 2022, Jogger has successfully entered the station wagon market. Jogger sold 56,812 units in its first year on the market and is the second vehicle in the C segment (excluding SUVs) sold to individuals in Europe.

With 5 or 7 seats, Dacia’s new family model takes up the best of each category: the length of a station wagon, the roominess of a MPV and the attributes of a SUV.

Launched in 2021, Spring, Dacia’s 100% electric vehicle, reached 48,887 units sold in 2022, i.e. +75% vs 2021 and has recorded more than 100,000 orders since its launch. It is the 3rd best-selling electric vehicle to individuals in Europe. Designed to democratize access to the electric car for daily travel, Spring is becoming a benchmark city car in many markets and 80% of Spring buyers were not customers ofthe brand previously.

Designed around customer essentials, the Dacia range remains just as attractive thanks to its better-equipped versions. For example, 84% of Dacia Spring customers opt for the Expression trim, the Stepway versions account for 66% of Sandero sales and 63% of Duster customers opt for the Journey and Extreme versions. Finally, the Up&Go offer, which allows customers to benefit from a fully equipped vehicle delivered more quickly, is favored by 58% of Jogger customers and 24% of Duster customers in the countries where the offer

is marketed: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Romania + (Morocco Duster Only).

Alpine: ambitions driven by success

Alpine is still aiming higher one year after the presentation of the "Renaulution" plan. In January, Luca de Meo, CEO of Renault Group, visited Dieppe, the birthplace of the Alpine brand, accompanied by Bruno Le Maire, French Minister for the Economy, Finance and Recovery. Renamed on this

occasion, the historic manufacturing site saw its future confirmed with the announcement of the production of the future 100% electric GT crossover in around 2025, thereby ensuring the long-term future of manufacturing and of its employees.

01

A true flagship of the Group, Alpine saw its ambitions confirmed once

again with the announcement in November of a roll-out on new continents and a further expansion of the range to complement the three electric vehicles of the dream garage. As demonstrated by A110's historic results, Alpine successfully combines technological excellence with a passion for racing, particularly thanks to the bridges created with Formula 1. Driven by a unique commitment to motor sport, vector of a strong and international image, Alpine is aiming for pole position at all levels.

A high-end zero-emission global brand

After the recent Capital Market Day announcements, in late 2022, the Alpine brand is a true high-end brand, a full- fledged OEM, asset-light, tech focused, a team of 2,000 people, of which 50% are engineers. Being part of the Group ensures Alpine access to Ampere EV and Software technological assets.

Looking forward, Alpine will leverage commercial partnerships and investors support to accelerate its growth and international expansion.

In addition, Alpine plans to launch two vehicles with advanced technologies in the D and E segments to support its international expansion. Thus, half of Alpine’s growth will come from new markets beyond Europe, potentially including North America and China.

Alpine A110, 60 years old and just as much passion

In 2022, Alpine continued its development, expanded its A110 range and multiplied the number of news headlines and partnerships:

- Alpine A110 Tour de Corse 75 dons the colors of the legendary Berlinette of the 1975 Tour de Corse. With this limited edition of 150 cars, Alpine honors sportiness by celebrating a historic race;

- Alpine A110 GT J. Rédélé celebrates the centenary of the birth of its founder, Jean Rédélé, with a limited edition of 100 legendary cars;

- All-New Alpine A110 R, the most radical A110 ever built. This extreme, lighter, sharper and even more racing- inspired version tops the A110 range. The ultimate expression of lightness and performance, All-New Alpine A110 R is designed for a unique experience on the racetrack while remaining road-legal;

- A110 Sastruga is an original piece of work that places technological and scientific innovation at the heart of artistic creation. This unique piece is the result of a conversation between Alpine and Obvious, a collective that pioneered the use of artificial intelligence in art.

The future of Alpine is being written today

The brand is actively preparing a complete range of 100% electric vehicles. A first for Alpine! This exciting future takes on a sporty look with the Alpine Alpenglow concept car. It embodies the renewal of the Alpine brand, in terms

of design and technology, for its racing and production models. Alpine Alpenglow is more than a concept car, it is a true statement of the brand, a founding act of its ambitions and strategic plan and a source of inspiration for allfuture Alpines.

Unveiled at the French Grand Prix, the A110 E-ternité

prototype demonstrates

also Alpine's engineering expertise in electric sports cars. An exciting preparatory modelforthe Alpine dream garage, coming very soon.

Increasingly competitive Thanks to the performance of its two drivers and of the entire Franco-English team, the Alpine racing team fulfilled its goal of taking fourth place in the constructors’ championship. The team finished the year with 173 points:

Esteban Ocon took

eighth place in

the drivers’ championship with 92 points, just ahead of Fernando Alonso, in ninth place with 81 points. In the 2022 season, the team had eleven Top-Ten finishes in both single- seaters.

In the WEC, Alpine Elf Endurance Team and its drivers, Nicolas Lapierre, André Negrão and Matthieu Vaxiviere,

were runners-up in 2022, with two wins and two additional podium results. This result also concluded the first chapter of Alpine’s return to the top of the discipline. This superb record is crowned by a high-profile third place at the 24 Hours of Le Mans 2021, as well as two victories in the 1000 Miles of Sebring and the 6 Hours of Monza during the exceptional campaign of 2022.

Inclusion and diversity

In addition, 2022 saw the launch of the Rac(h)er program to actively promote inclusion and diversity at all levels of the company including Formula 1.

This commitment is reflected in the fact that the Alpine executive committee has already reached gender parity. This program is strengthen

designed to equal opportunities through meritocracy, regardless of gender and in all areas of the automotive industry.

1.2.1.2. Business - to - business Powertrain activity

The powertrain business provides major manufacturing R&D synergies with the other Alliance members and Renault Group partners. A dedicated department oversees this B-to-B Powertrain in

activity, both respect exchanges of powertrain parts with partners, and for related engineering activities. The aim of these synergies is to pool development costs, absorb fixed production costs, and generate economies of scale in the industrial activities of Renault and its suppliers in order to optimize Renault Group’s free cash flow. In addition to the alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, which share a common range of products, an industrial system and a supplier network, this activity seeks to promote and offer Renault’s powertrain units in the context of automotive cooperation or third-party sales. These operations enable our partners to benefit from Renault technology and give Renault access, where useful, to its partners’ developments and manufacturing capacity. This activity also serves to identify and set up one-off cooperation projects and to evaluate our competitiveness and level

of

of

quality

compared to our competitors.

Strengths

A modern, CO2-efficient powertrain range: with its internal combustion, hybrid and electric range, Renault has once again demonstrated its commitment to reducing the environmental footprint of vehicles throughout their life cycle. The qualities of the Renault powertrain range have convinced our partners of the advantages of using our engines fortheir vehicles.

Nissan, Renault’s partner in the Alliance, has thus relied on the latest generations of Renault engines to reduce average CO2 emissions in its range of passenger cars in Europe.

Renault Group is among the most efficient manufacturers in Europe in terms of certified CO2 emissions (based on 2021 CAFE). For more details, refer to chapter 2.3.2.1.2.3 “Tools and processes in place to manage risks and opportunities“.

The organization

In Renault’s Strategy, Business Development and Business Management Department, dedicated teams work to detect opportunities, bids negotiate and

prepare contracts. Sensitive to the expectations of carmaker customers, these teams allow for optimal responsiveness by interfacing with all Renault Engineering departments.

1.2.1.3. Main manufacturing sites – Production figures

01

To meet its customers demands, Renault Group relies on an industrial footprint of 34 Manufacturing sites located around the world as close as possible to the markets in which it sells its brands’ vehicles.

All these sites operate under common principles:

● making employee safety a priority;

● making customer satisfaction a priority;

● constantly working to improve the competitiveness of our sites, in particular through convergence towards our industry 4.0 vision (see section 2.4.3.7 “Plants that are transforming“);

● integration of the value chain.

The Alliance and Renault Group’s strategic partnerships offer opportunities for synergies based on the pooling of production resources and enable us to increase the industrial activity of our sites. Thus:

● the Flins, Batilly, Maubeuge, Sandouville and Cordoba plants produce vehicles for Nissan;

● the Maubeuge plant produces vehicles for Mercedes- Benz Group;

● the Sandouville plant produces commercial vehicles for Renault Trucks;

● finally, Nissan plants in Chennai (India) and Cuernavaca (Mexico) produce vehicles for Renault Group.

Concerning powertrain parts, the cross-utilization of Alliance plants makes it possible to share investments and optimize the use of our production capacities. Some examples:

● diesel engines are produced for Nissan in Renault Group plants in Cléon and Valladolid, and petrol engines and components in Valladolid and Mioveni;

● gearboxes are assembled for Nissan in Cléon, Pitesti, Seville, Cacia and Los Andes;

● Renault Group Le Mans plant manufactures chassis for Nissan and Mercedes-Benz Group;

● the Cléon foundry produces crankcase blanks for Mercedes-Benz Group and the Valladolid foundry produces crankcase blanks for Nissan;

● Nissan’s plants in Yokohama (Japan) and Chennai (India) produce engines (petrol and/or electric) for Renault Group, and Cantabria, Avila (Spain) and Sunderland (UK) produces mechanical components (rotors, cardles/ axles) for Renault Group.

Renault Group also relies on partnerships and/or industrial cooperation for the production of vehicles:

● in China: in Shiyan (eGT) for the production of Spring, in Nanchang (JMEV) for the production of vehicles for the Mobilize (Limo) and EV Easy brands;

●

in Lagos

(Nigeria), assembles

Coscharis DKD

(Dismantled Knocked Down) vehicles for Dacia.

1.2.1.4. The Renault Group sales network

Organization of the distribution networks

Renault Group distributes vehicles under its brands through both primary and secondary distribution networks.

The primary network is contractually bound to Renault Group brands via a concession agreement (or agency or authorized repair center agreement, depending on the country) and comprises:

● dealers independent of Renault Group;

● establishments belonging to Renault Group through its subsidiary Renault Retail Group (RRG) or branches.

The secondary network includes mainly smaller sites, independent of Renault Group, and bound contractually to the primary network, most often through an agency contract or through an authorized distribution or repair center contract. These are generally smaller sites whose role is to round out the territorial coverage of the primary networks of the Renault Group brands.

In the context of Renaulution presented at the beginning of 2021, the Renault and Dacia brands announced the renewal of their visual identity, the coordinated deployment of which started in 2022. At the same time, in collaboration with the Renault Enlarged Dealership Group (GCRE), Renault Group has redefined the bases of the future contractual relationship

with its Renault and Dacia Networks, whose new contracts will enter into force in 2024. Renault Group has thus confirmed its ambition to ensure sustainable and profitable growth for the Manufacturer and for its network by relying on strong independent players who promote the image of Renault Group’s brands while optimizing territorial coverage in order to meet customers’ expectations.

Customer satisfaction is a core focus of Renault Group’s policy. The acceleration of sales of E-Tech vehicles relies on the continuous upgrading of methods, support for networks, the spread of E-Tech services and the necessary skills.

Renault Pro+: the expert network of commercial vehicles for professionals

Since 2009, the Renault Pro+ network has been dedicated to serving and supporting professionals in more than 25 countries.

Nearly 600 Renault Pro+ centers make up this specialized network and apply specific standards that meet the requirements of professionals.

Whether regarding the choice of vehicles, including coach-built and customized light commercial vehicles, or advice from expert, trained teams or after-sales service, everything is done to satisfy the needs of professionals.

Renault Pro+ is always at the side of professionals to guarantee the choice of a work tool adapted to their uses and its maximum availability over time.

1.2.1.5. Renault Retail Group (RRG)

A wholly owned subsidiary of the manufacturer, RRG is Renault Group’s leading European distributor of vehicle sales and related services and after-sales activities.

RRG’s mission is to distribute all of the Alliance’s products and services (Renault, Dacia, Alpine and Nissan, in some countries) to professional and individual customers.

Activities cover new vehicles, used vehicles and spare parts and includes maintenance,

also mechanics, bodywork, express repairs (Renault Minute), short-term rental (Renault Rent), mobility services (Renault Mobility), financing and brokerage.

RRG has nearly 101 sales and service outlets in six European countries: Germany, Spain, France, Italy, United Kingdom and Switzerland.

In 2022, RRG pursued its plan to change the scope of its operations by selling in France the establishments located in Angers (Group Rouyer), Tours, Loches-Chinon and Le Mans (Group Gemy), Rouen and Le Havre (Group

Mary) to reliable and robust buyers who have preserved jobs. Furthermore, RRG moved out of the Courcelles building (Paris 17), which had been rented; activities and staff were allocated to the other sites in Paris. The same applied to Lyon Est, whose operations and staff left the site, which is up for sale, for other sites in Lyon.

Following the same principles, some sales were also made outside France:

● disposal and closure of activities in Poland (4), Czech Republic (1), Belgium (3), Luxembourg (3) and Portugal (2);

● partial disposal of activities in Italy (1) and Spain (8).

The other two highlights in 2022 were:

● a return to profitability with a positive operating margin, reaching €85 million, driven by NV and UV activities which showed strong growth in profitability, thanks to the optimisation of the mix of channels and unit margins;

● the launch of the Tekion project: a new business management system that will enter the test phase in 2023.

1.2.1.6. Automotive cash flow management

For Automotive, Renault Group has established a financial organization whose aims are to:

● automate the processing of routine cash inflows and outflows;

● meet the subsidiaries’ refinancing requirements and pool surplus cash;

● centralize the handling of euro-denominated and foreign exchange transactions so as to optimize the management of currency, liquidity, interest rate, counterparty and country risk while reducing financial and administrative costs;

● centralize virtually all financing operations, including securities issuance, bank loans and credit agreements, at parent company level.

Within this framework, Renault’s Financing and Treasury

Department (DFT),

which is responsible

for cash management and financing for the Group’s industrial and commercial activities, has a specialized entity, Renault Finance, which it uses to25

● conduct capital market trading after intra-Group netting: forex, rates, commodities and short-term investments;

● make foreign currency payments for French and European subsidiaries;

● subsidiaries (United Kingdom, Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic).

conduct cash pooling in the currencies of certain

For the euro zone, cash is centralized through a Renault

S.A. IT platform that manages all subsidiaries’ euro-

denominated transactions and interfaces with

the

automotive sector’s banks.

Outside the euro zone, Renault Finance offers certain subsidiaries access to centralized cash management tools.

Renault Finance

A Swiss company domiciled in Lausanne, Renault Finance is active in the international financial markets, following a set of strict risk management rules. Its arbitrage activity allows it to obtain very competitive quotes for financial products from foreign exchange markets, interest rates or

raw materials. This natural makes it Renault’s counterparty for most automotive market transactions. By extending this service to the Nissan group, Renault Finance has become the Alliance’s trading room.

To optimize the quality of the service provided to the Alliance, Renault Finance is equipped with some of the most advanced tools on the interbank markets and has a wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore, Renault Treasury Services.

Business activity3

Despite an automotive market still penalized by the semiconductor shortage, Mobilize Financial Services is experiencing 3.3% increase in new financing compared to 2021, driven by higher average amounts financed.

01

In an automotive market down 4.6%, the volumes of the Alliance brands stood at 1.90 million vehicles in 2022, down 5.7%. The penetration rate amounts to 44.8% down 1.3pt compared to 2021.

Electric vehicle financing reached 82,179 units in 2022, i.e., 6.9% of the number of new financing contracts compared to 6.4% in 2021.

New financings (excluding credit cards and personal loans) stood at €18.0 billion, up 3.3% thanks to the 10.4% increase of the average financed amount.

Average performing assets (APA)4 related to the Retail Activity totalized €38 billion in 2022. The amount increased by 1.8%, thanks to the progression observed on the new financings.

Average performing assets linked to the Wholesale Activity amounted to €6.4 billion, down 9.8%, due to electronic component shortage and stock optimization policy in the dealer network implemented by Renault Group. Overall, average performing assets totalized €44.7 billion, down slightly 0.1% compared to 2021.

The number of insurance and service contracts sold in 2022 account for 3.8 million down 4.7% compared to 2021 especially due to the fall of registrations and number of new financing contracts.

Europe region remains the main pillar for Mobilize Financial Services activity, with new financings (excluding credit cards and personal loans) totalizing €15.8 billion, up 2.7% compared to 2021, and representing 88% of Mobilize Financial Services new financings. The growth is mostly concentrated in Germany and in the UK.

Results

Net banking income (NBI) amounted to 2,045 million euros, up 11.9% compared with the previous year. This increase is partly explained by a one-off positive impact of 101 million euros related to the valuation of interest rate swaps covering sight deposits in the context of rising interest rates. The contribution to NBI from Services activities represented 32.7%, down slightly by 2.9 points compared with 2021.

Operating expenses amount to 624 million euros, up 54 million euros compared to the end of 2021. They represent 1.39% of NPAs, an increase of 12 basis points compared to 2021. This 12 basis point increase is linked to investments to support the growth of our client finance business and the development of new activities such as car

subscription.

compared with 0.26% of net banking income at end-2021. This is in line with historical trends, after a year of increased provisions for Covid in 2020 and reversals of these provisions in 2021 following the normalization of the health situation. The cost of risk on the network’s business (concessionaire financing) was a reversal of -0.33% of NPA at the end of December 2022, versus a reversal of -0.52% at the end of December 2021. The total cost of risk was 0.44% of the APM, or 195 million euros, compared with 0.14%, or 62 million euros at the end of December 2021.

Balance sheet

In 2022, the average performing assets of the Retail Customers business increased thanks to growth in new financing. The network activity’s

Dealer average productive assets were negatively impacted by the semiconductor shortage as well as the optimization policy

for vehicle inventories in

the

dealer network,

implemented by Renault Group brands.

At the end of December 2022, net assets5 amounted to €49.5 billion, compared to €45 billion at the end of December 2021 (+10.2%).

Consolidated equity amounted to €6,310 million compared with €6,222 million at the end of December 2021 (+1.41%).

Solvency

The overall solvency ratio6 came to 16.84% (including a CET1 ratio of 14.47%) at end-2022, compared with 17.68% (including a CET1 ratio of 14.76%) at end-December 2021. The decrease in the overall ratio is explained by the increase in RWEA (+€2,008m), largely due to the rise in network business (+€1,542m), and by the inclusion of structural foreign exchange risk in the market risk (+€1,002m in RWEA). This increase in REA8 is component7 partially offset by an increase in CET1 capital (+339 M€) due to a reduction in EL/PROV9 (+257 M€) and to the integration of the half-yearly result deducted from the forecast dividend (+100 M€).

5 Net assets at year-end: net total outstandings + operating lease transactions net of depreciation and impairment.

6 Ratio including interim profits net of forecast dividends, after approval by the regulator in accordance with Article 26 (2) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.

7 Guideline (EBA/GL/2020/09) on structuralforeign exchange positions applicable from 1 January 2022.

8 Risk Exposure Amount: RWA (Credit Risk), CVA, Operational Risk and Market Risk.

9 The calculation of EL/PROV deductions at sound or defaulted portfolio level rather than at the contract level as in the previous year (CRR article 159

confirmed by Q&A EBA 2013_573) led to an increase in CET1 capital (+€212m) partially offset by a decrease in T2 (-€113m).

Financial policy

The tightening of the monetary policies of the main central banks (a direct consequence of the increase in inflation following the outbreak of military operations in Ukraine) and the decline in activity in China due to its zero- Covid policy have led to a slowdown in global economic activity.

In the United States, after the contraction in activity in the first half of the year, growth is expected to remain subdued over the coming quarters. The labor market is still robust with an unemployment rate that stays low (3.5% at the end of December). Inflation continues to be very high but is starting to show the first signs of slowing down (6.5% in December compared to 7.1% in November, 7.8% in October, 8.3% in August).

The persistence of a tight labor market and high inflation led the Fed to begin its monetary tightening cycle in March. The Fed Funds rate target was thus raised by 425 bps to reach 4.25-4.50% at the end of December.

The ECB increased its key rate by 250 bps during 2022, raising the marginal deposit rate from -0.50% to 2.00%. It plans to raise interest rates further to ensure a rapid return of inflation to its medium-term target of 2%. The ECB also specified that it will begin to reduce its balance sheet from the beginning of March 2023 (the asset purchase program “APP” portfolio will be reduced by an average of €15 billion per month until the end of the second quarter of 2023, and its subsequent pace will be determined over time).

The Bank of England (BoE), one of the first central banks to have started the monetary tightening cycle, has raised its key rate several times, bringing it to 3.50% from 0.25% at the end of 2021.

Fears of stagflation led to high volatility in the financial markets. In Europe, bond yields rose in the path of US rates. The ten-year German sovereign bond rate rose above the 2% mark to 2.57%, compared to a level of -0.19% atthe end of 2021.

Following the slowdown in inflation in the United States and Europe, equities and corporate bonds, which had suffered in the second and third quarters, began to recover at the end of the year. After hitting a -25% decline at the end of September, the Euro Stoxx 50 ended the year at 3,793, down -11.74%. Credit spreads experienced a similar trend: after peaking at 138 bps in July, the IBOXX Corporate Bond Euro index stood at 99 bps at the end of December compared to 61 bps at the end of

December 2021.

In this volatile market context, the Group issued the equivalent of €2.8 billion in 2022 and launched its first green bond for €500 million. Proceeds are being used to

finance electric vehicles and charging infrastructures. This transaction demonstrates the Group’s willingness to support

the transition to electric mobility and its commitment to tackling climate change. The Group also returned to the Swiss market, with the placement of a CHF110 million bond with a three-year maturity and extended the maturity of its debt with a €650 million transaction with a six-year maturity. Two issues of €750 million at 3.5 and three years respectively were also carried out.

In securitization market, the the Group placed approximately €700 million in notes backed by auto loans granted by its French subsidiary. The Spanish branch also carried out its first securitization, issuing €1.1 billion in self- subscribed Senior notes, which reinforced the liquidity reserve.

The retail savings activity proved to be particularly dynamic and competitive in terms of funding cost. Deposits allowed to reduce the impact of the increase in the cost of market funding, thus demonstrating the relevance of the

financing

diversification strategy initiated 10 years ago. Savings deposits received increased by €3.4 billion since the beginning of the year to stand at €24.4 billion.

These resources, to which should be added, on the European scope, €4.4 billion in undrawn confirmed bank lines, €4.6 billion in collateral eligible for Central Bank monetary policy operations, and €5.8 billion in high quality liquid assets (HQLA), enable the Mobilize Financial Services group to maintain the financing granted to its customers for 11 months without access to external liquidity. As of 31 December 2022, the liquidity reserve of the Mobilize Financial Services group (Europe scope) stood at €14.9 billion.

RCI Banque’s overall sensitivity to interest rate risk remained below the Group’s limit of €70 million.

As of December 31, 2022, a parallel rise in rates would have an impact on the Group’s net interest income (NII) of €0.78 million, with the following contribution by currency:

● -€1.6 million in EUR;

● -€0.3 million in BRL;

● -€ 0.1 million in KRW;

● +€ 1.0 million in GBP;

● +€0.1 million in PLN;

● -€ 0.3 million in CHF.

The sum of the absolute values of the sensitivities to a parallel interest rate shock10 in each currency amounts to €7.0 million.

The group RCI Banque’s consolidated transactional foreign exchange position11 is €12.7 million.

10 Since 2021 and in accordance with EBA (IRRBB Guidelines), the magnitude of interest rate shocks depends on the currency. As of 31 December 2022, the interest rate shocks applied for each currency were: +100 bps for EUR, CHF, DKK and MAD; +150 bps for SEK and GBP; +200 bps for CZK; +250 bps for HUF; +300 bps for RON, COP and PLN; +350 bps for BRL; +500 bps for ARS and RUB.

Mobilize simplifies access to new mobility through a comprehensive, usage-based offering ranging from mobility solutions to energy and data. It thus encourages the ecological contributes to the achievement of Renault carbon

transition and neutrality

Group’s

objectives.

In 2021, Mobilize presented four 100% electric vehicles purpose-designed for service and the user experience at the heart of their design. Their market launch will also be innovative since users will only pay for what they use based on time or mileage.

● Mobilize Duo: a shared mobility solution adapted to the needs of cities and operators (compact, connected two- seater with a small footprint;

● Mobilize Bento: a solution for the delivery or transport of small-sized

goods. The compact Mobilize Bento will facilitate city center access and parking for delivery people and craftspeople;

● Mobilize Hippo: a light commercial vehicle designed for last-mile delivery in urban, suburban and Low Emission Mobility Zones (LEZ-m);

● Mobilize Limo: a sedan designed for taxi drivers and private-hired vehicle drivers. It is offered on a subscription

1.2.2.3. Partnerships and cooperation

Renault Group is committed to the development of shared mobility services (Renault Mobility renamed Mobilize Share in 2021, Zity by Mobilize in Madrid, and Paris/Paris region, in partnership with the Ferrovial group), and has made acquisitions and takeovers targeted participation in various start-ups in this field (Karhoo, iCabbi, glide.io and Bipi, a “car subscription“ offer platform, which was acquired by Mobilize F.S. in July 2021). The Worldwide Mobility Department with the support of Renault M.A.I (Mobility as an Industry) has made it possible to accelerate synergies since 2020, simplify the decision- making chain, clarify existing offers and create new ones, with the launch on January 14, 2021, of the new Mobilize Business Unit which now brings together all services (financial with Mobilize F.S., Energy, Mobilities).

basis and has been marketed in the form of flexible packages since 2022 in Madrid and Paris.

Mobilize brings together several initiatives and start-ups around mobility and energy ecosystems:

01

● Zity by Mobilize, this self-service, car-sharing service is available in Madrid (since 2017) and in Paris and several nearby municipalities (since 2020) as well as in Lyon and Milan;

Mobilize has also launched several connected services to promote the adoption of electric vehicles:

● “Mobilize Charge Pass“: this app provides access (location, routing and payment) to a network of more than 260,000 charging stations across 25 European countries. The app is available in Germany, Belgium and Spain;

● “Mobilize Smart Charge“: this app allows Renault EV owners to optimize the cost of charging their car at home while reducing their carbon footprint and is available in France, the Netherlands and Belgium;

● “Battery Certificate“: this app allows owners of Renault and Dacia electric vehicles, in France, to create a certificate showing their battery’s remaining energy capacity directly on their smartphone or the internet. Objective: to facilitate the sale of used electric vehicles.

Mobilize is committed to carbon neutrality, the circular economy and extending the life cycle of vehicles. Within the Flins Refactory, Mobilize is centralizing initiatives to

extend the life cycle of vehicles and batteries. It implements solutions for the reuse of batteries, in particular for energy storage solutions, and thus supports the energy transition.

Mobilize solutions can be combined within the territories to help them achieve carbon neutrality, as is already the case in the Smart Islands, in Europe (Porto-Santo, Belle-Île-en-Mer, Ile d’Yeu, etc.), and in Brazil (Fernando de Noronha).

Together with various partners, Renault Group develops and offers its customers energy-related services so that they benefit from all the advantages of their electric vehicles. For example: Renault Goup created the Elto entity in 2020 in order to offer its professional customers tailor-made charging solutions. These offers are already deployed in 11 countries in Europe with local partners: in France with Solstyce, in Germany with GP Joule, in Belgium with Enersol and in Spain with IBIL.

Renault Group has also entered into a partnership with Jedlix, since 2017, a Dutch technology start-up, with which the Group has developed a smart charging mobile application which makes it possible to control the charging of electric vehicles, guaranteeing users carbon-free electricity and savings on their energy bill. This service, operational in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, is intended to be deployed in other European countries. In 2021, Mobilize Ventures strengthened its commitment to Jedlix as part of a capital increase carried out with 2 new energy partners, leaders in their markets: the Japanese group Osaka Gaz and the Norwegian Skagerak.

1.3 Alliance Renault - Nissan - Mitsubishi

01

1.3.1 Overview

The Alliance between the Renault and Nissan groups constitutes the most sustainable and

productive multicultural strategic collaboration in the automotive industry. For 24 years, this partnership has offered a unique, pragmatic and agile model, always able to evolve and integrate new projects and partners. Extended to Mitsubishi group, it forms the largest automotive alliance in the world.

1.3.2 History

On March 27, 1999, Renault and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd (‘Nissan’) entered into the founding agreement of the Alliance, the Alliance and Equity Participation Agreement (the ‘AEPA’). Under the provisions of the AEPA, Renault acquired a 36.8% stake in Nissan’s share capital and subscribed for share subscription warrants that enabled it to increase its stake first to 39.9% and then to 44.4% of Nissan’s capital. For its part, Nissan was given the opportunity to acquire a stake in Renault.

Nissan’s turnaround and the Alliance’s rapid success led the partners to take a new step forward by accelerating the implementation of their financial agreements, and further institutionalizing their commercial and industrial cooperation.

Accordingly, on December 20, 2000, Renault and Nissan entered into the Alliance’s second framework agreement, the “Alliance Master Agreement” (the “AMA”), which was reiterated and updated on March 28, 2002, in the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement” (the “RAMA”).

Under the AMA and then the RAMA, Renault strengthened its stake in Nissan, and Nissan acquired a 15% stake in Renault’s share capital:

● on March 1, 2002, Renault increased its stake in Nissan from 36.8% to 44.4%; on April 6, 2010, a share exchange agreement between Renault, Nissan and

Daimler resulted in Renault’s stake in Nissan decreasing from 44.4% to 43.4% at the same time as Daimler entered the capital of Renault and Nissan;

● on March 29, 2002, and May 28, 2002, Nissan increased its stake in Renault to 15% through two capital increases reserved to Nissan Finance Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissan;

The Alliance has proven its leadership in electric vehicles and is developing the innovative of tomorrow’s autonomous, connected

technologies and affordable vehicles.

The Alliance aims to create value for each partner and for all stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, etc.).

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of the French Commercial Code, Renault shares held by Nissan Finance Co. Ltd. are not taken into account in the calculation of the quorum, and do not confer voting rights, i.e., the voting rights attached to such shares cannot be exercised at Annual General Meetings.

In application of the RAMA, Renault-Nissan B.V. (“RNBV”) was incorporated on March 28, 2002. This Amsterdam- based company has been owned equally by Renault and Nissan since 2002. It was designed to coordinate the common activities on a global scale and contribute to the preparation of the Alliance’s strategy and mid and long- term planning (see section 1.3.3.3 “Powers of RNBV”).

In the context of the increase by the French State’s stake in the share capital of Renault in 2015 and then the introduction of double voting rights, the Board of Directors of Renault authorized, on December 11, 2015, the signing of the following agreements, which the Annual General Meeting approved on April 29, 2016:

● a governance agreement entered into on February 4, 2016, between Renault and the French State, aimed at restricting the free exercise of the French State’s voting rights for certain decisions submitted to Renault’s Annual General Meeting;

this

agreement is described in section 6.2.6.2 “Shareholders” agreements on shares and voting rights of the Company;

● a third amendment to the RAMA, signed on December 11, 2015, between Renault and Nissan that enshrines in particular the constant practice of non-interference of Renault in the governance of Nissan.

On October 20, 2016, Nissan, which is 43.4% owned by Renault, acquired a 34% stake in Mitsubishi Motors, thus becoming its largest shareholder.

The acquisition of Mitsubishi Motors by Nissan enabled the expanded Alliance to consolidate its industrial position.

On March 12, 2019, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors formed the Alliance Operating Board, the body that oversees operations and, in practice, performs the governance functions of the Alliance, signaling a new beginning for the world’s leading automotive alliance.

In 2020, the three partner companies reaffirmed that the Alliance is essential for strategic growth and improving their respective competitiveness. Thus, on May 27, 2020, the Alliance announced the adoption of a new business model for cooperation.

Each member becomes a reference in the regions where it has the best strategic assets, and acts as a facilitator and provider of support for the competitiveness of the others. build

The three members on the Alliance’s existing strengths, such as joint purchasing, by leveraging their respective leadership positions and geographic strengths to support their partners’ development.

1.3.3 Functioning of the Alliance 1.3.3.1. The Alliance Operating Board

The Alliance Operating Board, created on March 12, 2019, is in charge of operational coordination between Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and will take new initiatives that will create value for their respective

shareholders and employees.

This new Alliance Operating Board comprises four members, appointed by Renault Group (two members, including the Chairman of the Alliance Operating Board), by Nissan (one member), and by Mitsubishi Motors (one member).

As of December 31, 2022, the Alliance Operating Board was composed of Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renault and Chairman of the Alliance Operating Board, Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Renault, Makoto Uchida, Chief Executive Officer of Nissan, and Takao Kato, Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors.

The decisions of the Alliance Operating Board are made by all members by consensus. The Alliance Operating Board meets monthly, and as often as the Alliance’s interest requires, in France, in Japan or by videoconference when necessary.

The Alliance Operating Board oversees the operations and performs the governance functions of the Alliance.

The Alliance Operating

Board’s General Secretary, Véronique Sarlat-Depotte, appointed in April 2021, is tasked with coordinating and facilitating the Alliance’s major projects launched to accelerate the operating efficiency of the respective companies. and reports to the Alliance Operating Board.

The Alliance Operating Board is assisted by specific operating committees that make recommendations on new sources of value creation between the three carmakers.

During 2022, Alliance members were always at the forefront of the industry in terms of their performance, products, technologies and markets, while continuing to benefit from joint purchasing and development.

During the 2022 AOBs12, the Alliance Operational Board met seven times, including twice in Japan and once in France. In addition, a meeting of the Boards of Directors of Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors was also organized in Yokohama in November 2022 in order to share the progress of joint work, and an extraordinary workshop took place in December 2022 in France, in order to accelerate synergies. Strategic plans for platforms, vehicles, powertrains, batteries, electronic architecture and advanced engineering have been reviewed, as every year. The ranges of each company were shared and reviewed in depth, and new

synergy projects were studied.

Opportunities were clearly identified, the work plan was established, and technical roadmaps were recognized and shared.

A global product plan for 2025 (ICE + xHEV + BEV), 80% based on common platforms, is being rolled out, as is the BEV-specific product plan, increased to 90% by common platforms (vs. 0% at the end of 2020).

Regarding the future battery strategy, the Alliance is converging towards shared common technology/cost/ capacity roadmaps. For a next generation of electric vehicles, the Alliance has selected a single supplier to produce its batteries for Renault Group and Nissan in France, the UK, Japan and China.

With regard to connectivity, the Alliance plans to market connected vehicles and associated services based on a common electronic equipment packaging, all coupled with an unprecedented launch: GAS (Google Automotive Services), the world’s first for a general manufacturer, which will expand more widely in all ranges in the coming years.

The Alliance is also strengthening its regional/local cooperation in certain countries. In Europe, for example, Renault Group is working closely with Mitsubishi Motors on several cross-badging projects in the B-segment with regular follow-up meetingsand milestones.

An “Alliance Com” event was held on January 27, 2022, during which Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors announced a common roadmap for 2030 (described below) dedicated to electric vehicles and smart and connected mobility, sharing investments for the benefit of its three members and their customers.

Alliance vision for 2030

Moving together for the benefit of each

The Alliance

members

have developed

a “smart differentiation” methodology that defines the desired level of commonality for each vehicle, integrating several parameters of possible pooling, such as platforms, production plants, powertrains or vehicle segment. This is supplemented and enhanced by a stricter approach to design and upper-body differentiation. For example, the common platform for the C and D segment carries five models from three brands of the Alliance (Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail, Mitsubishi Outlander, Austral and upcoming Espace). Strengthening this process, the Alliance

members will enhance usage of common platforms in the coming years from 60% today to 80% of its combined 90 models in 2026. This will allow each company to deepen their focus on their customers’ needs, their best models and core

markets, while also extending innovations across the Alliance, at a lower cost.

As part of this, Mitsubishi Motors will reinforce its presence in Europe with two new models, among them the new ASX based on Renault Group best-sellers.

Five common EV platforms: the largest global offer of the industry

01

Renault Group, Nissan

and

Mitsubishi Motors

have pioneered the EV market, with more than €10 billion already invested in the field of electrification. In the main markets (Europe, Japan, the US, China), 15 Alliance plants already produce parts, motors, batteries for 10 EV models on the streets. More than one million electric cars have been sold to date and 40 billion kilometers driven.

Building on this unique expertise, is

the Alliance accelerating with a total €23 billion more investment in the next five years on electrification, leading to 35 new EV models by 2030.

90% of these models will be based on five common EV platforms, covering most markets, in all major regions:

● CMF-AEV, the most affordable platform in the world, is the base for the new Dacia Spring;

● KEI-EV, (mini vehicle) platform family for ultra-compact EVs;

● LCV-EV, family

platform

family for professional customers, as the base for the Kangoo and Nissan Town Star;

● CMF-EV, the global, flexible EV platform is already on the roads as the base for the Nissan Ariya and Megane E-Tech Electric.

The CMF-EV platform, with

its technological innovations and the potential offered by its modularity, is a benchmark platform for a new generation of electric vehicles for the Alliance partners.

Commonbattery strategy, breakthrough battery innovations and a planned 220 GWh production capacity: bringing the most attractive offer

inthemarketto all customers

Competitiveness is key, and that has led member companies to a common Alliance battery strategy, especially through the selection of a common battery supplierfor Renault Group and Nissan in core markets.

The Alliance is working with common partners to achieve real scale and affordability, enabling a reduction of battery costs by 50% in 2026 and 65%by 202813 .

By 2030, the Alliance will have a total of 220 GWh battery production capacity around the world.

Beyond that, the Alliance shares a common vision for all- solid-state battery technology (ASSB). Based on its deep expertise and unique experience as a pioneer in battery technology, Nissan will lead innovations in this area that will benefit all Alliance members.

The ASSB technology will double the energy density versus current liquid lithium-ion batteries. Charging time will also be greatly reduced to one third, enabling customers to make longer trips with more comfort.

The aim is to mass produce ASSB technology by mid-2028 and, in the future beyond that, to realize cost parity with ICE vehicles by bringing costs down further to $65 per kWh13 , accelerating the global shift to EVs.

The Alliance also

has a state-of-the

art battery management system. Unlike others in the industry, the Alliance has chosen to control 100% of its hardware and software, benefiting from very valuable predictive data, allowing for monitoring the state of health of the battery and improving technology.

The Alliance is working with strategic partners to offer the best solutions to customers for public charging. Mobilize Power Solutions provides to B2B customers a complete end-to-end service including project design, installation, maintenance and management of optimized recharging infrastructure and all related services to meet their

business needs.

An agreement has been signed with Ionity via the Alliance Emobility Service Provider Plug Surfing, which will allow its customers to access at preferential pricing to the Ionity ultra-fast charging network in Europe.

With more than 10 years’ experience in the EV business, Alliance members have deep knowledge that allows them to be ahead of the competition in optimizing battery

reuse, notably with second-life battery applications, recycling and achieving efficient and sustainable

solutions over the full battery life cycle.

25 million cars connected to the Alliance Cloud by 2026:the best-in-class digital experience for customers

Intelligent and connected mobility are critical areas for increased shared innovation across the Alliance.

With 20 years’ experience in ADAS (advanced driver- assistance systems) and autonomous driving, the Alliance keeps improving real-world driving safety, convenience, and enjoyment by delivering innovations in intelligent driver-assistance technologies, with an example being Nissan’s award-winning ProPILOT system. vehicle and

With shared platforms and electronics, by 2026 Alliance members expect to have more than 10 million vehicles on the road across 45 Alliance models equipped with autonomous driving systems.

Today, 4 million vehicles are already connected to the Alliance Cloud with ongoing data exchanges.

By 2026, more than 5 million Alliance cloud systems will be delivered per year, with a total of 25 million connected cars on the road. The Alliance is also the first global, mass- market OEM to introduce the Google ecosystem in its cars.

Under Renault Group’s leadership, the Alliance is developing a common centralized electrical and electronic architecture converging electronics hardware and software applications to offer maximum benefits and an optimal level of performance.

The Alliance will launch its first full software defined vehicle by 2026. With this technology, the Alliance will improve the performance of its cars ‘Over The Air’ throughout their life cycle. This will mean greater value added for customers, in particular with the integration of the car into their digital ecosystem to offer them a personalized experience, new enhanced services and reduced maintenance costs. This will also allow Alliance members to boost vehicle resale values. In addition, these vehicles will be able to communicate with connected objects, users, and infrastructure, opening new fields of value for the Alliance companies.

The Alliance’s unique digital experience will be the gateway to an unprecedented amount of data, paving the way to the automotive industry’s next frontier, with Renault Group, Nissan Motors and Mitsubishi Motors positioned at the forefront of this revolution.

1.3.3.2. New chapter of the Alliance partnership

Following the approval of the Boards of Directors of Renault Group and Nissan Motor Co, Ltd, the Alliance announced on February 6, 2023, a series of new initiatives to take its partnership to the next level.

A three-dimension program to maximize value creation

for all Alliance stakeholders will include:

● high-value-creation

operational

projects

in Latin America, India and Europe;

● enhanced strategic agility with new initiatives that partners can join;

● a rebalanced Renault Group-Nissan cross-shareholding and reinforced Alliance governance.

Renault Group and Nissan have entered into a binding framework agreement regarding the above-mentioned transactions, with a view

of reaching

definitive agreements by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The transactions contemplated in definitive these agreements would be subject to a limited number of conditions precedent, including regulatory approvals, and completion is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023.

This far-reaching program paves the way for renewing and strengthening the 24-year partnership, creating a new spirit and leveraging the technologies of all three Alliance new

members. This partnership will create additional opportunities for growth and improve the operational efficiency of each company to innovate and transform in the rapidly changing automotive and new mobility market.

High-value-creation operational projects

A year after defining the Alliance roadmap to 2030, the companies are announcing key new projects in Latin America, India and Europe that aim to deliver mutually beneficial, large-scale and tangible results to Alliance members along three dimensions: markets, vehicles and technologies. Each company will benefit from these value-creating projects in the medium term, while realizing short-term benefits through cost sharing and optimization.

Latin America

The four projects to be considered in Latin America include:

● a new pickup developed by Renault Group and shared with Nissan in Argentina;

● the successful collaboration on the existing Nissan Frontier/Renault Alaskan pickup family will continue. Renault Group will produce the pickups in Cordoba (Argentina) for Renault Group and Nissan;

● in Mexico, Nissan will produce a new model for Renault Group. For the first time in 20 years, a Renault vehicle would be produced in Mexico;

General presentation of Renault Group

Enhanced strategic agility with new initiatives that partners can join

In the second area of partnership, all three Alliance companies agreed to build on their existing electrification and low-emission technology strategies by investing and collaborating on partner-specific projects that would add value to each other.

These agile strategic initiatives are designed to

strengthen the business plans of member companies, including Nissan Ambition 2030 and Renaulution, by maximizing commonalities and investment opportunities

to achieve their respective sustainable growth and decarbonization goals.

The areas of collaboration include:

● Nissan’s intention is to invest up to 15% in Ampere, Renault Group’s EV & Software entity in Europe, with the aim to become a strategic investor. Through this intended investment in Ampere Nissan would enhance and accelerate new business opportunities for Nissan in Europe.

● Mitsubishi Motors is also reportedly

investing in Ampere.

considering

● Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors would become customers of Renault Group’s Horse project, an initiative to achieve further scale and market coverage for its low-emission internal combustion engine (ICE) & hybrid powertrain technologies.

These initiatives would complement ongoing areas of technology collaborations such as All Solid-State Battery (ASSB), Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) & autonomous driving.

A rebalanced Renault Group-Nissan cross-shareholding and reinforced Alliance governance

As each delivers on its business plans, it was important to put in place a cross- shareholding structure and governance terms aligned to the goals of the next-generation Alliance. Whilst previous Alliance agreements enabled the companies to execute their respective strategies over the last 24 years, a new approach is required to enable the Alliance members to best prepare forfuture industry opportunities.

Alliance member company

Renault Group and Nissan, the founding-members of the Alliance, have therefore agreed to rebalancing their cross-shareholding and governance terms to ensure effectiveness and maximize value creation.

A binding framework agreement defines the principles of a new governance scheme and the rebalancing of the cross- shareholdings between Renault Group and Nissan. The two companies intend to enter into a new Alliance agreement by March 31, 2023 and replace the current agreements governing the Alliance (i.e., the Restated Alliance Master Agreement, the Alliance Equity Participation Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding of March 12, 2019).

74

This new Alliance agreement would be put in place for an initial period of 15 years.

Rebalanced cross-shareholdings between Renault Group and Nissan to enable future collaboration

● Nissan and Renault Group would retain a 15% cross- shareholding, with a lock-up obligation, as well as a standstill obligation.

● Renault Group would transfer 28.4% of Nissan shares into a French trust. The entrusted shares would be voted neutrally, except for:

● the election or dismissal of the directors of Nissan nominated by Renault, (where the trustee would vote as directed by Renault);

● the election or dismissal directors who are nominated by the Nissan Nomination Committee, other than the Renault Group nominees (where the trustee should vote in favor of the Nissan Nomination Committee decisions and proposals).

of

● shareholder proposals not supported by the Nissan board of directors (where the trustee should abstain).

● Renault Group would continue to fully benefit from the economic rights (dividends and shares’ sale proceeds) from the entrusted shares until such shares are sold. The transfer to the trust would trigger no impairment in Renault Group financial statements.

● As a result of the transfer of the 28.4% of Nissan shares to the trust, Nissan would be able to exercise its voting rights attached to its shareholding in Renault Group.

● The voting rights of Renault Group and Nissan would be capped at 15% of the exercisable voting rights, with both companies able to freely exercise their voting rights within such limit.

● Renault Group would instruct the trustee to sell the entrusted Nissan shares if commercially reasonable for Renault Group, but it has no obligation to sell the shares within a specific pre-determined period of time.

● Renault Group would have full flexibility to sell the Nissan shares held in the trust, within a coordinated and orderly process with Nissan, in which Nissan would benefit from a right of first offer, to its or the benefit of a designated third party.

Voting rights & governance

● As a result of the new arrangements, the governance agreement entered into on February 4, 2016, between Renault Group and the French State related to its shareholding in Renault Group would be terminated. This would enable the French State to exercise freely all its voting rights in Renault Group.

● Renault Group would remain entitled to nominate two representatives at Nissan’s board of directors, and Nissan would remain entitled to nominate two representatives at Renault Group’s Board.

● The Alliance Operating

Board would

remain

the

coordination forum for Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.

1.3.3.3. Renault-Nissan B.V.(RNBV)

Since 2002, under the RAMA, RNBV has had decision- making and recommendation powers concerning

strategy and planning at Alliance level.

Furthermore, RNBV is the sole shareholder of Alliance Purchasing Organization (APO), created in April 2001 under the corporate name Renault-Nissan Purchasing Organization (RNPO).

RNBV does not intervene in the operational management of Renault or Nissan and does not share in the profits or bear the associated risks. Operational decisions are made and implemented by each company to the extent that such company is affected by them.

This company is not consolidated due to its non- significant nature in accordance with the accounting principles described in note 2-C of the consolidated financial statements presented in section 5.2.2.6.2.

Powers of RNBV

In accordance with the RAMA, Renault and Nissan had delegated certain powers to RNBV pursuant to a management agreement signed on April 17, 2002, for an initial period of10 years (the “Management Agreement”).

In April 2012, the Management Agreement was renewed for another 10-year period pursuant to an agreement entitled Renewal Agreement of the Management Agreement, the provisions of which are identical to those of the Management Agreement (the “Renewal Agreement ofthe Management Agreement”).

The Management Agreement has expired on April 16, 2022, and has not been renewed. Renault shareholders were informed of this during Renault’s General Meeting of May 25, 2022.

As long as the RAMA exists, and until new agreements are reached (see section 1.3.3.2), RNBV will have the decision- making and recommendation powers listed in the RAMA. However, these decisions are no longer directly applicable within Renault s.a.s. and have to be formally ratified by the governance bodies of Renault s.a.s. on a case-by-case basis.

The list of RNBV powers under the RAMA is restrictive and has not changed since the creation of the Alliance.

1.3.4 Strategic cooperation

The Alliance has demonstrated its ability to cooperate with various partners. These strategic cooperations make it possible to increase economies of scale, accelerate growth in new regions, gain access to new technologies, share costs and jointly fund research and development of next- generation vehicles and engines. Existing and potential partners of the Alliance especially appreciate its ability to deepen collaboration over several business cycles.

One of the Alliance’s strategic collaborations is the one with the premium manufacturer Mercedes in April 2010.

This cooperation is managed by a Cooperation Committee co-chaired by Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Alliance Operating Council, and Mr. Ola Källenius, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and composed of senior executives from Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and Mercedes. This committee oversees the implementation of agreed projects and makes proposals for new projects. No area of collaboration is excluded. When the teams identify projects that could benefit all partners, they initiate feasibility studies. If the executives and board members of all companies agree, the project is approved.

In 2018, Mitsubishi Motors has been fully integrated into the cooperation with Mercedes.

76

The key projects

in which

Renault is currently participating are as follows:

● Renault and Mercedes have developed a joint platform for Smart and Twingo. The electric Smart was launched in 2017, followed by the electric Twingo in 2020. The electric motors are built at the Renault plant in Cléon. The battery for the electric Smart is produced by a Mercedes subsidiary, ”Deutsche in

ACCUmotive”, Kamenz, Germany, the battery for the Twingo is produced in Novo Mesto (Slovenia);

● Renault developed a small light commercial vehicle based on Kangoo for Mercedes. This vehicle, named Citan, has been manufactured in the Renault Maubeuge plant since 2012. The successors of Kangoo and Citan in thermal version were launched in 2021, and the electrical version is in development;

● the Alliance and Mercedes have jointly developed a direct-injection turbocharged small gasoline engine family (1 L and 1.3 L). These new, more compact engines feature state-of-the-art

technology enabling improvements in fuel economy, as well as significant reductions in emissions. The new engines debuted in Mercedes, Renault and Nissan vehicles in late 2017.

1.4.1 Advanced Research and Engineering

Innovation within the Renault Group is handled at all levels and involves all stages from design to production of a vehicle. The ability to innovate is supported by levers such as the network of experts or the many partnerships.

Research and Advanced Engineering activities are managed cross-functionally within the various Engineering sectors via a structured plan shared throughout the company. This global plan covers all vehicle and mechanical applications, products, processes, after-sales and services.

The innovations worked on are developed to serve brands, business and customers.

Renault Group identifies the key innovations of tomorrow very early on. It can be a very innovative product concept such as the minivan in 1983 or the first Twizy and Zoe electric vehicles in the early 2010s. A nugget can also be a major technological breakthrough such as the engine to hydrogen. New uses can also give rise to nuggets of high value such as new mobility services, data monetization or even the second life of batteries. Regulatory changes such as the ban on internal combustion vehicles by 2035 in Europe forthe sale of new cars are also to be considered.

Research and Advanced Engineering activities are divided into 4 perfectly complementary categories.

The Research plan and doctoral theses (under CIFRE agreement for the most part) shed light on the future and prepare for future technological breakthroughs. Their purpose is to identify, anticipate and prepare Renault Group for future trends to

be incorporated into developments over a period of 5 to 10 years.

The Technological plan makes it possible to prepare

innovations

with a view

to vehicle or component

80

applications by developing new technologies over a period of 3 to 5 years. It materializes the innovations to be introduced in platforms, engines, systems and the vehicle range plan.

These two plans are based on three main pillars: the planet, the territories and the people.

Research and Advanced Engineering are also in charge of the production of numerous demonstrators (Demonstrator plan) which aim to inspire the future range plan by allowing a grouping of technological bricks in order to compare innovations with realistic integration into a vehicle, and thus potentially bring out new automotive concepts.

Finally, an essential axis is the development of simulation/ validation tools and models through the Performance Engineering plan. This plan aims to make breakthroughs in methodologies, expertise and multiple skills (business, process, sales, marketing, organization and management).

The Research and Advanced Engineering plan is a joint Alliance plan which is structured around the plans presented above to fully meet the prioritized needs of Product, Design and Engineering. The aim is to develop innovations to serve future customers and to guarantee the competitiveness of the vehicle range by pooling the development capacities of the two companies, where the objectives are common. Cooperation with the Alliance also increases the Renault Group's patent portfolio.

The budget for Research and Advanced Engineering activities in 2022 is distributed across these 4 plans. in

1.4.2 Innovation performance levers

The performance of engineering is assessed by its ability to innovate and anticipate while mastering its diversity through standardization.

1.4.2.1. The network of experts

The changes affecting the world are of a nature and magnitude unprecedented for the planet. They are also for the automotive sector. In the two context of

concomitant revolutions (digital and energy transition), the fundamentals of the market as well as the regulatory and technological bases are or will all be called into question. For the company, it is a question of differentiating itself by knowing and listening to our markets – translated into permanent innovation – and of positioning itself in new sectors of activity, with a high degree of scientific and technical knowledge. In this context where the mobilization and transformation of knowledge are becoming strategic, the expertise sector occupies a central place by giving itself the means to identify and then capture the value created by knowledge in order to put it at the service of Renaulution and offer an advantage. competitive to the business. The sector expertise represents 43 areas of strategic expertise such

as "Artificial

Intelligence", "Electrical and Electronic Architecture", "Immersive Simulation and Virtual Reality", "Manufacturing", "Logistics", etc. This sector is organized into fourlevels of expertise:

● the Expert Fellow responsible for defining and ensuring the consistency of the strategic areas of expertise and coordinates the Experts Leaders network in order to structure production both at the strategic level and the operational level regarding technical or methodological

innovations and support

for projects under development. The collaborative work carried out during expert workshops contributes to a dynamic of shared progress for the affected business activities as regards the Company’s main challenges, which are largely technical (hydrogen, coupling of complex systems, additive manufacturing, etc.). The network of experts can thus be described as an agile organization serving the cross-business and

the construction of shared roadmaps up to CEO level for strategic technologies;

● the 43 Seniors Expert, each reporting to a Department Head, are responsible for their roadmap. Responsible for one of the 50 areas of strategic expertise. They structure and guide their internal network of experts and use an consisting

external network of universities, other manufacturers, associations, incubation structures, etc., to enable the Company to work inan ‘extended’ way;

● the 250 Experts are in charge of secondary fields of expertise, responsible for benchmarks, identifying relevant partners and investing in the protection of know-how through patents. They are responsible in particular for defining and promoting standards and processes;

● the 500 Specialists further the state of the art in their practice, developing standards on which the teams can then capitalize.

The organization of the network of experts and its agile mode of operation allow the way ahead to be mapped out using a set of coherent roadmaps, the enhancement of knowledge to be accelerated through innovation and the performance of operations, thus allowing the business activities to excel in their various areas of expertise.

1.4.2.2. Renault Group engineering centers (RTX- Renault Technical Center) around the world

Renault Group engineering centers are located in Spain, Romania, Korea, India and Latin America. Thanks to their knowledge of local and regional markets, they are tasked with adapting vehicles to the customers needs and expectations, local regulatory constraints and national economic situations. Through the application of a skills upgrading policy that continues from year to year, Renault Group

continuously

82

increases the responsibility of with

engineering centers for cross-functional activities and enables them to take charge of vehicle project design at an increasingly early stage in the process. This upskilling also enables the most mature RTX to move from regional to more global responsibilities. The engineering centers be assigned new responsibilities under the new organization that will be put in place in 2023 through the Horse entity.

will

1.4.2.3. Open-innovation labs and links with start-ups

Another important lever for the company is the global ecosystem of Renault Group open-innovation laboratories, known as “Labs”. The Labs have existed for a decade and are complementary to the other processes and entities of the

Renault Group. They allow for unscheduled, rapid innovation, in test mode & learning by “doing it yourself”. In France and historically born in the movement of Fab Labs and Maker culture, the Creative Lab has introduced several hundred employees to the use of rapid prototyping means (3D printing, engraving, cutting, thermoforming, etc.). The Creative Lab with thematic Labs (Smart EV Lab, Electronic-Shaker Lab, Car Data Lab, AfterSales Lab, etc.) brings together the community of Group makers. He is able to support project leaders from idea

to completion, to help with

technological plan projects and to launch challenges for Renault Group brands. The labs make it possible to develop know-how and internal skills on innovation topics. Another example, the Collective Intelligence Laboratory is led by an internal collective of coaches, facilitators and actors of transformation who have consulting activities with other collectives of the company, and synchronization on collective activities. intelligence

between these different sectors.

The other Labs are located in strategic areas where the world of automobiles and services is changing rapidly: Israel, China, or even Brazil in order to ensure continuous technological monitoring of emerging trends, increased knowledge of customer needs in closer to the field and also to strengthen the link with technological partners around the world. The Labs also make it possible to test the potential of a partnership with a start-up.

1.4.2.4. Innovation partnerships

The vehicle of tomorrow will be frugal in terms of energy, greatly reduced in weight, connected and able to replace the driver for all or part of their activities, this is a challenge that can only be taken up collectively. For Renault Group, R&D collaboration contracts make it accelerate the of

possible to

development the

technologies necessary to meet these challenges, but also to enrich skills by sharing costs: a key lever for bringing innovations to fruition more quickly in order to introduce them. more in vehicle projects. In the world of competitive industry, performance and frugality, whether industrial or academic partners, this mode of collaborative innovation is encouraged by public funders at both French and European level. Materialized in the form of public aid (subsidies, repayable advances), it is an additional lever for

accelerating innovation. In this context, the participation of the Renault Group in cooperative initiatives has always been a priority in the activities of Research and Advanced Engineering, which is an effective tool in the service of the growth of the "Renaulution" strategic plan. In 2022, Renault managed a portfolio of 60 subsidized projects on average, split equally between French projects and European projects. 21 projects were submitted during the year: 10 were accepted, 6 are still under review, and 5 were refused. In particular, Renault remains very active in the CORAM system (2022

version)

(Steering

Committee Automotive Research and Mobility) with 3 ambitious projects submitted (1 refused and 2 under investigation).

for

Academic partnerships

Renault Group has always worked with leading schools and the best academic partners. In 2022, the CIFRE campaign allowed the collection of 34thesis subjects.

Below are some examples of theses addressed in 2022:

● self-supervised

multi-camera perception for situational awareness inside and outside the cabin;

joint

● improvement of oxygen reduction reaction in PEMFC fuel cell;

● modeling and simulation of different architectures of electrical systems with a view to energy

their optimization. Application to the electric vehicle;

● all-solid, green, inexpensive and fast-charging battery;

● energy modeling of manufacturing workshops;

The chairs are also an important lever. Below are some examples:

● "Supply Chain of the Future" with Ponts Paristech as well as Michelin, Casino, Louis Vuitton;

● "Theory and methods of innovative design Ph1, Ph2" with Mines Paris Tech and Armand Hatchuel as well as Dassualt Systèmes, RATP, Thales and Valourec;

● "CyberSecurity" with Telecom ParisTech, WaveStone, Thales, Nokia, Valeo, ANSSI, Road Safety Delegation, etc.

FOCUS on a flagship collaborative project: NeVeOS to ensure the digitaltransition

The NEVEOS project (Next gen Vehicle Operating System), filed as part of CORAM 21, is part of the Renault Group's transformation and the repositioning of its engineering skills towards software. The challenge lies in the speed of development of a new electronic architecture of the vehicle of tomorrow and therefore of sovereignty for the industry by imposing a French standard for software services and the future ecosystem. The project continued in 2022, with in particular the passage of the first Key Stage, during an event bringing together all the project partners and the funder at the Technocentre.

1.4.2.5. Technology Partners

In order to constantly explore new opportunities for innovation, Renault Group joins forces with the best companies on the market in multiple fields.

With regard to battery cells, Renault Group has chosen to partner with Envision AESC, which will develop a gigafactory in Douai with a capacity of 9 GWh in 2024 aiming at reaching 24 GWh by 2030. Close to Renault ElectriCity, Renault Group’s partner will produce latest technology, cost-competitive, low-carbon and safe batteries for electric models,

including the future Renault 5.

Renault Group has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to become shareholder of the French start-up Verkor with a stake of over 20%. The two partners intend to co-develop a high-performance battery suitable for the C and higher segments of the Renault range, as well as for the Alpine models. The partnership also includes the development of a pilot production line in France for battery cells and module prototyping from 2022. In a second step, starting from 2026, Verkor aims to build the first gigafactory for high performance batteries in France, with an initial capacity of 10 GWh for Renault Group, potentially rising to 20 GWh by 2030.

Renault Group keeps one step ahead of competition by being the first OEM to develop its own e-motor – with no rare earth (no-permanent magnets) and based on synchronous electrically excited

motor (EESM) technology, along with its own reducer. Having already done most of the investment, the Group has been able to cut the battery cost by two over the past ten years and will divide it by two again in the upcoming decade. Renault Group will gradually

embed new technological improvements from 2024 on its EESM: stator hairpin, glued motor stack, brushless and hollow rotor shafts; lowering costs and improving the efficiency of the motor.

Renault Group has also signed a partnership with the French start-up Whylot for an innovative automotive axial flux e-motor. This technology will first be applied on hybrid powertrains aiming to reduce the costs by 5% while saving up to 2.5 g CO2 on WLTP (for B/C-segment passenger car). Renault Group will be the first OEM to produce axial flux e-motor on a large scale from 2025.

On Power Electronics, the Group will extend its value chain control by integrating the inverter, DC-DC converter and the on-board charger (OBC) into a unique box produced in-house. With a compact design, this One Box Project will be 800 V compliant, with fewer parts to reduce the cost, and will be used across all platforms and powertrains (BEV, HEV, PHEV) for further scale effect. Power modules

On top of these new technologies, Renault Group is also working on a more compact e-powertrain called the all-in- one system. This e-powertrain consists in integrating the e-motor, the reducer and the power electronics (One Box Project) in a single package: enabling -45% volume in total (equivalent to the volume of the current-generation Clio fuel tank), -30% cost of the overall powertrain (this saving in value being the equivalent of the e-motor cost), and -45% on wasted energy on WLTP giving an extra EV range of up to 20 km.

Other technological partnerships in innovation are presented in Chapter Partnerships and

1.2.1.7: Cooperation.

1.4.2.6. Patents Filing

With the challenges posed by climate change and the development of digital technology, mobility is undergoing major changes. This real change of era is opening up new fields, and technological breakthroughs are occurring more and more rapidly in a wide range of areas, and Renault Group is adapting its strategy to position itself as a major player in the sector. Renault Group has always been able to innovate, and the significant acceleration in patent filings in 2022 (+30% vs. 2021) reflects the extent of the technological shift that the company is taking, for example in software or services. For example, further 300 patents have been filed for the New Megane E-Tech Electric vehicle and its CMF-EV platform. This figure demonstrates the vitality of innovation within the Renault Group and its determination to protect its inventions internally or with its partners.

Renault Group also continues to be inventive in its recognized areas of expertise, particularly in terms of engines. The wound rotor technology, resulting from the development of the Zoe and used in the collaboration with Valeo is a very good example. The partnership with Whylot, announced last November, to create a new type of electric motor, is another. The new patents filed under these partnerships cover a range of innovations applicable to the motor, but also to the charging system, the battery, thermal management, architecture and acoustics.

Industrialization solutions are also patented. The ability to integrate new technology on an industrial scale is one of Renault's strong points, and a definite contribution to the partnerships in which Renault Group is involved.

In 2022, the Renault Group patent portfolio will amount to 13,950.

General presentation of Renault Group

1.4.2.7. Digitaltransformation

Due to the growing complexity of vehicles (electrification, connected vehicles, driving aids, etc.), the explosion of on- board software and

increasing regulatory pressure, Renault Group is strengthening the configuration management and development processes for systems and software as well as their validation through its digital transformation. This transformation will enable the entire company

to collaborate and securely, seamlessly

efficiently in a single environment. All the players in the design (Process, Purchasing, Costing, Design, Quality, etc.) and validation processes, as well as partners and suppliers, will make the data on the vehicle product accessible around digital twins throughout its life cycle with the aim ofreducing costs and lead times.

Renault Group’s digital transformation continues with the Renaulution Virtual Twin” program. The Enterprise PLM (Product Life cycle Management) project, renamed Renaulution Virtual Twin’, is a major program that aims to transform and bring Renault’s design into a new era. This project will provide engineering and all of the company’s upstream businesses with a new digital tool for managing its product data and mobility services. Thanks to the extension of the digitalization of Engineering to the company, this tool will offer a lighter governance from design to after-sales.

Following 20 years of collaboration, Renault Group and Dassault Systèmes are strengthening their partnership to contribute to the "Renaulution" strategic plan. In a first-of-a-

kind deployment for an industrial company of this scale, Renault Group

is adopting the Dassault Systèmes 3DEXPERIENCE platform on the cloud globally to develop programs for new vehicles and mobility services.

This enterprise platform will offer lean governance from design to after-sales in order to reduce costs and vehicle development time. It will provide Renault with a new backbone for sharing, in real time, all product-related data throughout the product life cycle and for managing the digital twins in all the required configurations.

More than 20,000 of Renault Group’s employees will benefit from digital twin experiences to improve data sharing and collaboration across the company to reduce costs and vehicle development time.

This program will enable full deployment from design to after-sales, including industrialization, from 2022, with the objective of a completed solution in 2025.

In 2022, more than 2,000 users were trained, a gearbox was entirely developed on Dassault's new 3D Experience platform on the Cloud and a new innovative Renaulution vehicle (platform and upper bodies) was designed with Renaulution Virtual Twin, involving all the upstream departments (product/process/after-sales engineering, purchasing, costing, quality, etc.). The reduction of the cost of vehicles during their production life was also

resourced with Dassault Systèmes' data science/AI solutions while connecting the data managed by the legacy systems of the major functions (Engineering, Purchasing, Costing, Manufacturing).

1.4.3 Energy and digital transitions: a challenge for innovation

1.4.3.1. Digital transition

Software will play an increasingly important role in the vehicle of tomorrow, whether

for human-machine interfaces, multimedia and connected services, or even driver assistance systems. It is necessary to respond to the growing need for the customer for a service content and services that are enriched as and throughout the life of the vehicle, and this thanks to the software. We must also be able to accommodate the arrival at maturity of new technological solutions for the automobile.

Software Defined Vehicle

To meet such a challenge of digital transition, the company has put itself in working order in order to respond to the necessary changes in the embedded software architecture. The partnership with Google and Qualcomm announced at the end of 2022 will make it possible to develop the connected car of tomorrow. The

84

"Software Defined Vehicle" will bring together the best of the automotive and digital worlds, to offer new on-

demand services and enable continuous vehicle updates, building on the existing collaboration around Android Automotive which will be consolidated Renault Group with its partners in a vehicle operating system (CAR-OS).

by

The “Software Defined Vehicle” will make it possible to introduce new functionalities and services more and more quickly from development in the Cloud, and carried automatically in the vehicle. This centralization of the architecture has the advantage of reducing costs thanks to the reduction in the number of computers; improving the flow and fluidity of data exchanges as well as allowing better use of data to extend the services offered to customers. The vehicle “defined around the software” thus opens up an immense field of possibilities with new market prospects and technological innovations.

1.4.3.2. Energy transition

Today, is going the company one step further and committing to achieving a zero-CO2 impact by 2040 in Europe and by 2050 worldwide. By 2030, it aims to reduce its CO2 emissions by 50% compared with 2010. By 2022, all new models sold will have an electric or electrified version, in a market that in five years’ time will see 50% of vehicles sold running on electric or hybrid power.

The battery technology

Since the announcement of its electric-vehicle offensive in place since early 2007, Renault Group has been able to rely on recognized internal expertise (electrochemistry, materials

science, thermal

modelling, control

electronics, high-voltage

network, mechanical

packaging, etc.) to make the wisest choices in terms of cells, modules and lithium ion (Li-ion) battery packs in order to offer solutions in its electric and hybrid vehicles at the best level in terms of autonomy (energy density), performance over time (durability), reliability, cost and of course safety, which remains a priority objective over all the others. Witness the cumulative 14 billion kilometers traveled by the 600,000 Renault electric vehicles sold in Europe since 2011… without any major battery-related incident (no electric shock, no fire).

This upstream expertise has also extended to taking into account the entire life cycle of Li-ion batteries (from extraction of raw materials to dismantling and recycling): again, Renault Group has chosen to be a pioneer in this global approach and to participate in the development of more virtuous industrial as well as the in

sectors,

emergence of ‘second life’applications for batteries.

This expertise accumulated over time has enabled Renault Group to build up particularly effective cooperation with world-class cell suppliers in order to optimize

the performance and cost of its batteries without compromising safety and to carry out – with a view to creating ecosystems – promising collaborations on the various stages of the life cycle or on the emergence of energy services associated with vehicle charging.

The Group’s Research and Innovation departments are now continuing their work to push current Li-ion technology to the limits along several lines: energy density (to further increase the vehicle’s autonomy or to be able to reduce the volume of the battery pack), but also the charging power or the cost of batteries – depending on the uses and services targeted for each vehicle.

‘Post-Li-ion’ alternatives are also being looked at, in particular ‘all-solid state’ technologies (’ASSB’ – All Solid State Battery’), or even mixed solid-liquid or gel-type solutions.

Renault Group is the first car manufacturer to act on the entire battery life cycle, from raw materials to recycling and second-life applications. The Renault

Group's ambition is also to develop a battery "made in France", green, carbon-free and responsible, thereby helping to reduce the carbon footprint of its batteries by up to 35% by 2030 (reference: Zoe 2019).

Renault Group is also developing “vehicle-to-grid” (V2G) solutions, which send energy back to the electricity grid

from

the battery of an electric car. These V2G technologies will have a double benefit: economic (for the customer, for the electricity network operator and for Renault), but also technical (support for the development of renewable energies by providing storage capacity).

01

At the end of their first life in the vehicle, batteries may still contain around two thirds of their capacity and can be reused for a second life. Mobilize is developing new applications around stationary battery storage to manage punctual power needs, mobile electricity storage or generators for use in other industries. Through Mobilize, the Group is pioneering this market and has defined a unique industrial setup to lead this market in Europe:

● the collection of end-of-life batteries with the support of its dealer network;

● the ability to assess their condition, thanks to real-time technical monitoring;

● the industrial capacity to refurbish

batteries at

repackage the upcoming competitive prices and 250,000 units of Zoe leased batteries.

End of life: through its subsidiary Indra and its long- standing partnership with Veolia, the Group benefits from a robust know-how in EV battery collection and recycling. It has already recycled a cumulative 75 MWh of batteries, half of which in 2020 alone. To go even further, the Group is deploying battery retrofitting, reuse, dismantling and recycling facilities through its Refactory project in Flins with the aim of generating more than €1 billion in revenues from these end-of-life and recycling activities by 2030.

THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL

To go further in recycling, Renault Group announced on October 13, 2022, the creation of THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL, the first company to operate across the entire value chain of the automotive circular economy, which aims in particular to become a European leader in closed-loop battery recycling.

Hydrogen

The reduction of CO2 emissions in the short term and the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2040 (Europe) then 2050 (World) require an in-depth overhaul of mobility technologies and ecosystems.

While electrification remains the backbone of Renault Group's strategy, other technologies are being studied so as not to miss any opportunity, even in niche uses.

This is why Renault very early on initiated upstream studies to assess the potential of hydrogen, in a global approach (analysis of the life cycle "from the cradle to the grave").

In January 2021, Renault Group and Plug Power Inc., the world leader in fuel cell systems and hydrogen-related services, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which was formalized in June with the creation of a 50/50 joint venture named Hyvia. This new company based in France, with its headquarters and R&D center based in Villiers-Saint-Frederic, aims to achieve a 30% market share of hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in Europe by 2030.

Hyvia offers a unique range of services on the market: complete turnkey solutions, including the supply of

exploring other applications. Through concept cars such as Renault Vision and Alpine Alpenglow, Renault Group confirms its technological excellence and stands ready to make the most of this technology according to the evolution that the global hydrogen ecosystem could take.

1.4.4 Focus on some products and technologies of 2022

New engines, patented innovations, Advanced Driver- Assistance Systems (ADAS), multimedia system… Engineering is at the service of Renault Group and our brands. The selection below is not exhaustive.

1.4.4.1. Renault Austral:the tech SUV

Engines with the best level of consumption and emissions

Austral offers a range of innovative powertrains, with different electrification technologies to cover all uses without changing habits: a new generation of the E-Tech “Full Hybrid” system as well as two other petrol engines: a Mild Hybrid Advanced 48V with 130hp and a Mild Hybrid 12V with 140 and 160hp.

The self-charging E-Tech "Full Hybrid" engine has been the subject of 200 patent applications. It was designed to propel a higher segment vehicle and generate more performance and driving pleasure while reducing consumption and CO2 emissions. It receives a new 1.2-litre turbocharged 3-cylinder petrol engine associated with an electric motor, a 2 kWh and 400V lithium-ion battery, and an intelligent automatic multi-mode gearbox with optimized claws. This engine thus displays a combined power of up to 146kW, or 200 horsepower. As with the previous generation of E-Tech Hybrid engines, all starts are 100% electric to provide the driving pleasure specific

to electrified vehicles, combining silence and responsiveness. Equipped with this new E-Tech Hybrid engine, Austral displays optimal consumption and CO2 emissions (from 4.5 l/100km and 102 g/km of CO2) for the best possible cost of use. Hybrid SUVs (HEV) on the market.

The centerpiece of Austral's cabin, the OpenR screen is full of technologies to accommodate future updates to the OpenR Link system and offer an experience that is fluid, rich and also scalable. Connected to the cloud, it receives automatic updates through FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) technology. Like a smartphone, OpenR Link is operated intuitively and offers many possibilities for

customization. In order to

enrich its

catalog

of

applications and improve the on-board customer experience, Renault is developing partnerships with publishers. The brand is thus the first in the world to offer Waze directly in the multimedia screen of the vehicle, without activating the smartphone.

1.4.4.2. Renault Megane E-Tech Electric:the high-tech compact car

01

Ultra-thin battery

Much like its new power train, the Megane E-Tech Electric also has a new 395 kg battery designed to fit perfectly on the CMF-EV platform. At 110 mm (for 1,960 mm length and 1,450 mm width) – 40% smaller than the Zoe battery – it is the thinnest on the market. It contributes to lowering the total height of the vehicle at 1.50 m for better aerodynamism and efficiency. In order to attain such a compact size, engineers had to turn to a new chemical make-up for its batteries with the lithium-ion NMC (Nickel, Manganese, Cobalt) batteries by LG, which have more nickel and less cobalt for greater energy density. Reaching 600 Wh/L, it is 20% more than the Zoe. They also benefit from a new liquid coolant system located in the battery’s lower housing unit – a Renault first – that makes the battery more compact and efficient thanks to the extruded aluminum tubes. Measuring only 18 mm high, it makes fitting the battery pack on the platform much easier, leaving more room for overall design and space.

Balanced performance

Megane E-Tech Electric comes with a choice of two battery capacities:

● 40 kWh for a range of 300 km (WLTP cycle);

● 60 kWh for a range up to 470 km (WLTP cycle, depending on each version).

The 40 kWh battery is made of 8 modules of 24 cells each, distributed over a single layer. The 60 kWh battery consists of 12 modules of 24 cells each, spread over two layers. In both cases, the battery’s dimensions remain unchanged, including the record height of 110 mm. They come with an 8-year guarantee. In this interval, they will be replaced free of charge if they deteriorate to less than 70% of their nominal capacity.

High energy efficiency

The range of the All-new Megane E-Tech Electric in everyday use is increased in all conditions, in summer and winter. This is thanks to the vehicle’s high efficiency. This has been made possible thanks to

the many

affordable charging possibilities (see below), but also thanks to optimized energy recovery management and heat exchange that harnesses a new, patented, three-part system:

● new generation heat pump that improves the battery’s coefficient of performance by 30% (-10 °C) compared with Zoe. It incorporates a completely new heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and now uses electronic valves;

● intelligent system for managing energy lost by the batteries and powertrain, which reuses it to heat the cockpit. This has been made possible by the arrival of a liquid cooling system for the batteries and powertrain (water-cooled oil);

● predictive charging management uses the route on the vehicle’s navigation system to set the battery at the appropriate temperature as the car nears a planned charging station. It makes the best use of the specific charging point’s capabilities for a faster and/or fuller charge.

With these technologies, a journey between Paris and Lyon, Paris and La Rochelle, Hanover and Copenhagen or Munich and Venice requires only a single short charging stop of 30 min, with an optimized consumption of only 12.8 kWh/100 km (WLTP).

Patented sound cocoon (Soaft Damping Foam)

The innovative “Cocoon Effect Technology”, developed and patented by Renault engineers, brings a level of audio comfort while driving that is unparalleled, even for a “naturally” silent electric car. A layer of sound-absorbing foam has been pressed in between the car’s floor and across

the whole battery. Improvements are best felt above 30 km/h as it creates a sort of sound cocoon most often found on upper segment models so passengers can better enjoy the silence, their music or conversational moments with other passengers even on motorways.

Moreover, the “Cocoon Effect Technology” very is lightweight; it weighs 3 kilos less than regular sound proofing. It is enhanced by additional door lining, the sort of “privilege” reserved for more premium models.

1.4.4.3. Dacia Jogger: the 7-seater family car

Family-friendly and versatile, Dacia Jogger seeks the best of each category: the length of a station wagon, the roominess of a leisure activity vehicle and the attributes of an SUV.

Modular roof rails

In the longitudinal position, they contribute to the design without penalizing the vehicle's aerodynamics. In the

88

transverse position, they act as a roof rack that can support up to 80kg (bicycles, skis, roof box, etc.).

This ingenious system is patented. Smart, practical, simple and economical, it embodies the Dacia spirit.

Record spaciousness and modularity

Thanks to its 3 rows, Jogger can carry up to 7 adults. Designed in the spirit of a Swiss army knife car, it offers more than 60 possible configurations. The rear space

includes a three-seater bench seat with 2/3-1/3 seat and backrest (in row 2)

folding

and, in the 7-seater version, two individually folding and removable seats (in row 3).

Jogger has a maximum cargo capacity of up to 2094 liters.

First Dacia model to be equipped with Renault Group hybrid technology

Jogger inaugurates the hybrid engine for the Dacia brand with a combined power of 140 hp, fuel consumption at the highest level and CO2 emissions from 108 g/km. It is based on technologies that are proven and recognized within the Renault Group, comprising a 90 hp 1.6 liter 4-cylinder petrol engine (HR16), two electric motors (a 50 hp motor and a high-speed starter/generator tension) and an electrified automatic gearbox, equipped with four reports dedicated to the thermal block, as well as two others allocated to the electric. This combined technology is made possible by the absence of a clutch.

Regenerative braking, combined with the high energy recovery capacity of the 1.2 kWh (230 V) lithium-ion battery and the efficiency of the automatic gearbox, offer:

● up to 80% of driving time in town in all-electric mode;

● fuel consumption savings of up to 40% (compared to an equivalent internal combustion engine in the urban cycle, without changing driving habits).

The 100% electric traction on start-up and the automatic transmission give Jogger comfort and ease of use to optimize driving pleasure and energy performance. The battery recharges while driving thanks to braking and deceleration.

Eco-G: petrol-LPG bi-fuel offer by Dacia

Dacia is the only manufacturer to offer a full range of dual- fuel petrol and LPG vehicles under the ECO-G label. Factory integration of this technology is a guarantee of safety and reliability. The duration of the manufacturer's warranty, the intervals and the cost of maintenance operations, the capacity of the boot are identical to those of a petrol version (the LPG tank is located in place of the spare wheel). The combined consumption of the ECO-G 100 engine in the WLTP cycle starts at 7.7 l/100 km in LPG mode (i.e. 118 g CO2/km), 6.0 l/100 km in petrol mode (i.e. 135 g CO2/km). By running on LPG, Dacia Jogger emits on average 10% less CO2 emissions than an equivalent petrol engine. In addition, it offers more than 1000 km of autonomy thanks to its 2 tanks: 40 l for LPG and 50 l for petrol. With Dacia, LPG combines ease of use, driving pleasure, reduced CO2 emissions and great autonomy. Depending on the country, bi-fuel petrol/LPG benefits from tax incentives or reductions, a low purchase price at the pump, or the absence of an ecological penalty.

1.4.4.5. Alpine A110R: lightness, aerodynamics and performance

Entirely made of carbon fiber, the bonnet of the A110 R loses 2.9 kg. The two air ducts optimize the aerodynamics of the sports car.

The Alpine A110 R is the most radical expression of performance and sportiness on the track, but also on the road. At the heart of its genesis: lightness, the chassis and the search for perfect aerodynamics, based on the optimal balance between improving ground support and reducing drag. Inspired by motorsport, many elements have been added or modified on the New Alpine A110 R to optimize its behavior at high speed. In particular, it has benefited from technologies and development tools in the wind tunnelfrom Formula 1.

90

The bespoke tuning and tuning of the Alpine A110 R's exclusive chassis, developed to get the best out of performance with its Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 semi-slick high-performance tyres, make it a car with unprecedented performance, perfect for the circuit and still homologated for the road.

If lightness is in Alpine's DNA, the engineers have gone even further in its expression. Thanks to the intensive use of carbon fiber, the Alpine A110 R weighs only 1082 kg, 34 kg less than the A110 S. With a weight / power ratio lowered to 3.6 kg / hp, this new sports car sprints to 100 km/h in just 3.9 seconds, completes the 1000 m standing start exercise in 21.9 seconds and is thus positioned among the best performing cars in its category.

The New Alpine A110 R stands out for its energy efficiency. By far the lightest in its category and with aerodynamics that combine low drag and significant downforce, this new sports car allows maximum energy efficiency in all driving conditions, which translates into an exceptionally low CO2 level (1/3 less minimum than the competition) and reduced consumption.

Made in France, at the Manufacture Alpine Dieppe Jean Rédélé, it opens a new chapter in the brand's know-how in terms of sportiness.

1.4.4.6. A110 E-Ternité:

a 100% electric prototype at the cutting edge of Alpine innovation

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the A110, Alpine has

unveiled the E-ternité, an A110 unprecedented prototype loaded with “Made in” Alpine innovations and projecting the brand into the future. A veritable rolling laboratory, the A110 E-ternité is a 100% electric convertible, which manages to retain Alpine's legendary agility with unparalleled lightness for an electric car in this segment!

The A110 E-ternité, 100% electric, is the result of real exploratory work. A link between a prestigious past and a 100% electric future, it illustrates the work that Alpine is currently implementing to develop its range of new models.

Committed to electrics for more than ten years, Renault Group is a pioneer in this area and has acquired rich and valuable experience in all automotive sectors. It is therefore quite natural that the teams began their reflections on the subject very early on. In the "restomod" spirit, the A110 has become the ideal support for this research work with a clear objective: to electrify a myth of sportiness recognized for its lightness and agility, all for a realistic

budget. Challenge succeeded with an A110 E-ternité produced in record time and presented in July 2022. A real source of inspiration and lessons for the engineers who are actively preparing the launch of the dream garage from 2024.

1.5 Regulatory environment

1.5.1 Vehicle manufacturing regulations

1.5.1.1. Generalframework

Vehicle manufacturing regulations are designed to meet the requirements of States regarding, on the one hand, the need to reduce the number and consequences of accidents to people, whether in vehicles or on public roads (such as pedestrians and cyclists) and on the other hand, the environmental impact of the vehicle fleet (reduction of pollutant emissions, noise or pressure on resources). The Group constantly ensures that it has appropriate tools to enable it to respond to these requirements.

The regulatory framework of the European Union, which is applicable to around

by extension

40 countries geographically in or close to Europe, allows approval granted in one European Union country on the basis of a common list of technical regulations to be recognized in another European Union country and registration in all European Union countries without additional technical constraints.

The European framework is historically the pioneer of many national technical regulations around the world. It is based in particular on Regulation (EU) No. 2018/858 on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, amended by Regulation (EU) of

No. 2019/2144 November 27, 2019, type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, as regards their general safety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users, called the ‘General Safety Regulation’ (GSR), which has reinforced approval checks and production process controls, as well as statistical and continuous oversight of vehicles placed on the market and many passive and active safety technical requirements from 2022.

Carmakers, and more generally the automotive sector, are involved in this continued strengthening of European technical regulations, within the framework of working groups organized by the European Commission and made up of the industries involved in the Member States. The automotive sector is also involved within the broader framework of the UN working groups, made up of around 60 countries and international organizations (including the European Union), to ensure regulatory changes are made while taking into account technical and industrial challenges and opportunities, as well as implementation deadlines.

It should be noted that the health situation experienced in 2020 and extended to 2021 resulted in some delays in the drafting of regulatory texts, but without delaying the adoption dates. Nor has it had any influence on the determination of the levels of regulatory requirements

92

whether in terms of active and passive safety or in terms of emissions and pollutants.

1.5.1.2. Pollutantemissions and CO2

In the last few years there has been a considerable change in regulatory requirements set out on pollutant emissions by Regulation (EC) No. 715/2007, amended by (EU) No. 2018/858 on type approval of motor vehicles with

respect

to

emissions

from

light passenger commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and

and

maintenance

information, supplemented by Commission regulation (EU) No. 2017/1151 of June 1, 2017, amended by (EU) No. 2018/1832.

Since September 1, 2018, the pollutants of all new passenger cars (PC) and light commercial vehicles (LCV) are measured using the Euro 6 and CO2 limits, during a new cycle that is more representative of use, called the WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light Duty Test Procedure). The WLTP was implemented one year later for new, heavier LCVs.

In addition to WLTP, which measures pollutants in the laboratory, a procedure known as RDE (Real Driving Emissions) was introduced in two stages. This procedure allows emissions to be checked real

under road conditions (driving, road profiles, weather, etc.).

The first interim stage, called Euro 6d TEMP, sets controls for NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions using a compliance factor of 2.1 and particulates by number (PN) using a compliance factor of 1.5,

taking measurement uncertainties into

account.

Euro

6d

TEMP been

has applicable to all new PCs and LCVs since September 1, 2019, and to all heavy LCVs from September 1, 2020.

A second step, known as Euro 6d, reduces this compliance factor to 1.00 for NOx and PN, and takes into account a measurement uncertainty margin of 0.43 for NOx and 0.5 for PN, it being specified that the latter factor will be revised each year in the light of progress in the Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) procedure and equipment. Euro 6d has been applicable to new models since 1 January 2020, and to all PCs and LCVs, as well as new heavy LCVs from January 1, 2021, and lastly to all heavy LCVs from January 1, 2022.

In addition to these regulations, which apply to exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions from the fuel systems of gasoline vehicles have also been reduced through a stricter procedure applicable to all new vehicles since September 1, 2019.

The regulation “emissions” (CE) No. 715/2007 is not limited to approval of new products but also requires the inspection of customer vehicles by the manufacturer and by any Member State. This is one of the few industries that

produce consumer goods for which vehicle inspection is required at between six months and five years, or 15,000 km and 100,000 km.

Three new intermediate stages called Euro 6e / Eu6bis / Eu6ebis which consist of corrections and FCM,

amendments to Euro 6d procedures, WLTP 3rd Act and RDE package 5, were passed on July 5, 2022. Their publication, expected atthe end of 2022, will take place in early 2023.

Without changing the Euro6 limits, these new stages introduce more stringent requirements:

● Euro 6e (September 2023 new vehicles / September 2024 all vehicles): reduction

of PEMS measurement uncertainties to 0.1 for NOx and 0.34 for PN;

● Euro 6ebis (January 2025 new vehicles / January 2026 all vehicles): extension of temperature conditions for RDE driving, introduction of an indicator tracking the use of an auxiliary emission-related strategy and reduction of the CO2 emission calculation factor for PHEVs;

● Euro 6ebis FCM (January 2027 new vehicles / January 2028 all vehicles): second stage of the reduction of the CO2 emission calculation factor for PHEVs.

The next major regulatory milestone is Euro 7. The European Commission commissioned a consortium of consultants (CLOVE) to develop a substantiated proposal for the technical

Euro 7 requirements. The CLOVE consortium issued proposals in April 2021.

The co-decision proposal to be submitted to the Parliament and the Council, expected at the end of 2021, has been repeatedly postponed and has not been taken during 2022. The Commission's ambition is for Euro 7 to be the final step before "zero emissions". *

At the same time, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission performance standards is applicable to new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. It

represents a very important component of climate protection in Europe.

The regulation (EU) 333/2014 had stipulated a limit of 95 g of CO2/km applicable to 95% of the passenger car fleet starting from 2020. Starting from 2021, the regulation (EU) No. 2019/631 defines the targets to be reached by 2030. It stipulates achievement by 2025 of a reduction of 15% compared with a start point calculated in 2021 and, in 2030, a reduction of 37.5% compared with this same start point. These objectives cannot be achieved without a significant increase in the share of hybrid and electric cars in the Renault range. In addition, regulation No. 2019/ 631 introduces an incentive to exceed a minimum level of zero- or low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) as a percentage of the range in 2025 and 2030.

Under the new package, Fit for 55, passed in mid-2022, these targets have been raised -55% in 2030, and -100% in

2035, respectively. This represents a total ban on marketing new vehicles that emit CO2 at the exhaust pipe: internal-combustion engines but also hybrids, whether rechargeable or not. The zero- or low-emission vehicles (ZLEV) incentive for 2030 will also disappear.

01

The same principles apply to light commercial vehicles, with a target of 147 g of CO2/km in 2020 and ambitions for a reduction of 15% in 2025 and 31% in 2030, compared with a base defined in 2021. Similarly, the Fit for 55 package raises these ambitions to -50% in 2030 and -100% in 2035, with the same consequences as for private vehicles.

While the ambition levels up to 2035 are already defined, some other points of the text were finalized in December 2022.

The health situation did not have a significant impact on regulatory requirements in terms of emissions, either on their content or their timing.

Regulation 2019/631 also stipulates a penalty of €95 per gram of CO2 and per vehicle sold in the event of failure to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. However, this regulation provides a certain amount of flexibility, such as the possibility of forming a pool between manufacturers or benefiting from gains made through eco-innovations.

This desire to combat global warming is found in other countries where Renault operates, such as China, Brazil and India. In addition, China in particular has comprehensive regulations for electric vehicles (pure and hybrid electric).

*Zero emissions in use:

no CO2 emissions or regulated atmospheric pollutants when driving, in accordance with the WLTP certification cycle, excluding wear parts.

1.5.1.3. Passive safety and active safety

The entry into force of (EU) regulation No. 2019/2144 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, components

and systems, and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, will require manufacturers to incorporate an entire series of safety systems and to design the structure of new vehicles into account aimed at

taking

new requirements minimizing the severity of accidents in head-on, side and rear impact collisions.

1.5.1.3.1. Passive safety

All newly approved PCs and LCVs from July 2022 will have to meet new requirements for head-on, side and rear impact collisions. The requirements will be applicable to all newly registered vehicles in the European Union from July 2024.

Two years after these dates, new requirements for the safety of pedestrians will apply to the front end of these vehicles, in order to extend the protection zones up to the windscreen.

1.5.1.3.2. Active safety

From July 2022, all newly approved PCs and LCVs (classes and N1) will be required to be equipped during manufacture with:

M1

● an AEB (Advanced Emergency Braking) system to reduce the risk of collision with other vehicles, whether stationary orin motion;

● an Emergency Lane Keeping system that brings vehicles back into their lane before an involuntary crossing (without indicator signals) of an unbroken line and alerts drivers in the event of an involuntary crossing of a broken line;

●

an Intelligent Speed Adaptation system capable of alerting the driver when vehicle speed exceeds the limits;

● a Driver Drowsiness & Attention Warning system, which should be based on analysis of activity at the steering wheel, pedals, etc.

These advanced driver aid systems (ADAS) will become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.

Two years after these dates, new ADAS will become mandatory in turn, such as the AEB system, which takes pedestrians and cyclists into account, and the Advanced Driver Distraction Warning system, which will require technologies that use cameras and image analysis algorithms.

From July 2022, all newly approved PCs and commercial vehicles (LCVs and public transit) must, depending on their PC, public transit, light LCV or heavy LCV category, be equipped with pedestrian and cyclist proximity detection and/or vision systems on the front, side and rear ofthe vehicle.

These systems will become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.

1.5.1.4. Cybersecurity

Regulation 661/2009 also introduces vehicle cybersecurity requirements (all categories) through the adoption of the new Geneva regulation that codifies this area. These requirements became effective in July 2022 for newly approved vehicles and will come into effect in July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.

These new provisions require manufacturers to put in place a very well-structured cybersecurity governance system to ensure traceability and transparency of all decisions and approvals in respect of the inspection authorities and require all state-of-the-art technical solutions that limit cyber risks to be considered in the design of their vehicles. The system must be accredited by a third party.

94

Renault's cybersecurity governance system was already "accredited" by UTAC and CNRV at the beginning of 2022, and extensions are currently taking place, notably with the addition of new production sites.

Several countries, including Japan, South Korea, Turkey and Israel, are in the process of adopting or will adopt similar requirements with the same timelines.

Alongside these requirements for setting up a system of governance of

the cybersecurity of their products, manufacturers will have to set up a system for managing software developments in order to ensure the traceability of update decisions and vehicle configurations.

The accreditation of Renault's software development management system is scheduled for 2023.

1.5.1.5. Autonomous and/or connected vehicles

Although not a compulsory feature, regulations for vehicles with driverless operation services cover, in the initial stages, systems that help drivers to stay in lane and to drive in congested traffic and on highways (Advanced Lane Keeping Systems).

Extensions to more ambitious use cases should become reality by 2025.

“Driverless” vehicles are a special

case that

will undoubtedly be handled through testing carried out at the national level, and authorizations issued locally, for public transport and other uses.

In parallel, the rules of the road are gradually beginning to be changed in order to authorize the use of these autonomous driving systems. The amendment to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which was adopted in 2020 and formalized in 2021, thus paves the way for developments in this direction in Germany, France and the UK.

Connectivity is also a special case, insofar as it involves several players outside the automotive sector, which is a real obstacle to the deployment of Intelligent Transport System solutions.

The European Commission is currently working on the introduction of electronic means, which are easier to deploy, of checking the condition of vehicles during the

Periodic Technical for

Inspection,

which vehicle compatibility could be imposed as early as the middle of the decade.

Lastly, the "connected vehicle" poses a significant challenge with regard to data and, in particular, "data access and transfers", whether to or from the vehicle, with substantial monetization and new business possibilities in the background.

The Data Act, currently being drafted by Brussels, aims to regulate this extremely promising data business, in which it is necessary to ensure that manufacturers maintain a balance between free competition and

intellectual property, subject to the laws that protect private data (General Data Protection Regulation).

1.5.1.6. Prohibited substances and materials and recycling

The substances regulation governs the registration of all substances and materials present in vehicles and sets out prohibitions and limitations of these substances and materials, with monitoring of each vehicle to avoid distribution on market of harmful or

the prohibited products and facilitate recycling of end-of-life vehicles and their batteries.

Global guidelines on regulatory substances and recycling of vehicles and batteries are mainly set by the European Union.

They include:

●

the European regulations, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals), POP pollutants), and

(persistent organic biocidal products for substances;

● the F-GAS regulation on greenhouse gases and the air-conditioning systems directive;

● the ELV (end-of-life vehicle) and recyclability directives on the end-of-life treatment of vehicles with minimum recovery, recyclability and reuse quotas and bans on certain hazardous materials;

● the evolving battery directive on battery recycling.

The European Commission’s Green Deal will prompt many vehicle design changes in the coming 5 to 10 years that will affect vehicle design and are expected to lead to:

● For substances, a ban on them before 2030 as long as they have a short-term or long-term negative effect on the environment and human and life health in general through an accelerated process of banning by entire families with limited exemptions. The ban on fluorinated substances (PFAS) started in 2020 and is expected to be gradually extended until 2027 to the entire family of 4,700 substances. This accelerated process applied for the first time to this PFAS family is expected to be extended rapidly to phthalates and all substances and their families since they are endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and to any substance that has a negative effect on the reproduction of living organisms (CMR substances), bioaccumulative

and toxic substances, substances that develop respiratory or skin allergies, or immunotoxic or neurotoxic substances.

The European Commission is expected call for any ban on the European Union to be extended worldwide as soon as an international convention of the UN environmental program allows it. This is the case for persistent organic pollutants (POP).

01

● For batteries, transformation of the current regulation limited to recovery criteria into a regulation covering their entire life cycle from the supply of raw materials to the processing of batteries as end-of-life waste, while introducing conditions to facilitate the extension of the life of batteries including the second life of batteries and the re-use of their parts. This new regulation would introduce:

● technical requirements for performance, durability, carbon footprint, demountability, recyclability and introduction of recycled materials for construction with new batteries;

● industrial organization requirements imposing on us the implementation of ethical rules throughout the supply chain (due diligence) to be periodically audited by the authorities;

● a new regulatory framework to facilitate the second life of batteries, including in non-transport sectors;

● a new obligation to communicate with customers through a digital passport regarding the summary of the technical and environmental performance of each battery;

● greater involvement in the operation of the collection and recycling channels through

the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy.

● For vehicles, transforming, like for batteries, the current regulations limited to recovery and recycling into regulations covering their

entire life cycle with requirements on the content of recycled plastic products and ethical requirements on our supply chain. This new regulatory content should be extended to all vehicles including large commercial vehicles.

Other countries such as China, Korea, Japan and India could also adopt specific requirements for the recycling of batteries and vehicles and/or emissions of materials present in vehicles to guarantee passenger cabin air quality.

1.5.1.7. Stronger oversight

The unique legal environment in European Union Member States shows a general trend towards more stringent requirements and oversight of them by regulatory authorities, whether through of

stricter monitoring approval tests, maintaining the performance of vehicles throughout their life via engine compliance inspections, maintaining the general condition of the rolling vehicle population via reinforced technical controls, enhanced verification of the compliance of production (COP) and monitoring the compliance of new vehicles put on the market.

General presentation of Renault Group

For example, through the new EU Regulation 2018/858, the European Union has decided to implement market oversight from September 2020 that consists of requiring each Member State of the European Union to conduct vehicle compliance inspections that include performance of approval tests on a sample of vehicles representative

of their national market. Another purpose of market oversight is the monitoring of the functioning of technical services and approval authorities in each European Union Member State to detect and correct malfunctions in the European approval system.

1.5.2 Environmental regulations

As part of its production of automotive vehicles and mechanical equipment and the sale of its products, Renault Group is required, in the various countries where its vehicles and products are located or marketed, to comply with certain regulations that

are directly applicable to it, in particular with regard to the sites and installations that operates and the substances used as part ofits production process.

Because of its activities, Renault Group is subject to environmental regulations, concerning, among other areas, emissions into the air, waste management and water and soil impacts.

The main regulations applicable to Renault Group’s industrial, and commercial activities are logistics

described below.

1.5.2.1. Industrial emissions

management

Directive No. 2010/75 of November 24, 2010, known as the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), replaced the Integrated Pollution Prevention and

Control (IPPC) Directive and six sector directives, including the large combustion plants directive (2001/80/EC).

The IED strengthens a number of requirements for the prevention and reduction of pollution emitted by industrial installations into the air, water and soil. It also establishes thresholds that are not to be exceeded.

It states that certain industrial facilities must first obtain administrative authorization. This authorization cannot be issued by the competent administrative authority unless certain environmental conditions are met (the operator takes adequate preventive measures against pollution and the facilities at least respect the regulatory thresholds).

One of the guiding principles of this directive is the use of best available techniques (BAT) to prevent pollution of all kinds. Activities that require administrative authorization must meet the BAT standard established, reviewed and updated by the European Commission, which publishes

96

the conclusions in the “BREF” (best available techniques reference document).

Most of the Group's industrial sites depend on the BREF STS (surface treatment using solvents) for automotive paint activities, which has been revised and whose new conclusions were published on 9 December 2020 in Decision (EU) 2020/2009. After submitting the review dossier, the sites concerned will have to put in place BATs by December 2024 to comply with the new thresholds established in this document. In addition, the revision of the BREF SF concerning foundries, and STM, concerning surface treatment activities, also started in 2019 and 2022, respectively. Following the same logic as the BREF STS, this revision will eventually set the future emission limits for these activities.

The IED Directive also requires a "base report" describing the concerned

facilities and comprising a soil and groundwater diagnosis before the facility is put into operation or before the first update of the authorization issued. Finally, the Directive redefines the requirement to restore the site upon cessation of activity.

1.5.2.2. Air emissions management

European Directive (EU) 2015/2193 of November 25, 2015, regulates emissions from medium-sized combustion plants. It sets emissions thresholds for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust into the atmosphere from combustion plants with a nominal thermal power greater than or equal to 1 MW and less than 50 MW, regardless of the type of fuel that they use. It also establishes rules to monitor carbon

monoxide (CO) emissions.

Operators must implement emissions monitoring in accordance with the requirements set out in Annexe III to this directive and periodic measurements in particular. CO measurements are required for all facilities.

European regulation (EU) 517/2014 of April 16, 2014, (F-Gas), which repealed regulation (EC) 842/2006 on January 1, 2015, aims to contain, prevent and reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.

This regulation:

● discourages the use of fluorinated gases with a high impact on the climate and encourages energy efficient and safe substitutes;

● continues to improve the containment and end-of-life treatment of products and equipment containing fluorinated gases;

● promotes consensus on an international agreement under the Montreal Protocol to gradually reduce HFCs, which are the main group of fluorinated gases;

● ensures that the European Union takes into account the latest scientific results obtained at the international level, as recorded in the IPCC fourth Assessment Report, as regards in particular the substances covered by the regulation and their global warming potential (GWP).

The regulation aims to reduce fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union by two thirds compared with their currentlevel by 2030.

Renault Group reviewed these obligations and is making the necessary arrangements to minimize the use of these substances and limit their discharge into the atmosphere. European Directive 2003/87/EC of October 13, 2003, establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading systems affects 11 Group sites in France, Spain, Slovenia and Romania. Its application for the 4th phase that has started (2021–2030) is mainly governed by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas

emissions.

This system requires sites subject to the regulation to report their greenhouse gas emissions each year and return a number of “allowances” equivalent to the metric tons of CO2 emitted. A certain number of allowances is allocated free of charge, and additional allowances may be purchased on the primary or secondary markets.

For the 4th phase, the allocation of free allowances is governed by strict rules, specified in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331. Annual greenhouse gas emissions are verified by an independent accredited third party as described in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.

Changes to this regulation, in particular the loss of the “carbon leakage” exposure status since the entry into the

4 phase, has greatly reduced the number of free

th

allowances for sites subjectto the regulation.

In Korea, an exchange system was put in place in 2015, by a 2012 law (Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowances) and an associated decree. The sites in Busan (RSM) and Giheung (since 2021) are subjectto this.

1.5.2.3. Water management

Renault is Group subject to applicable European regulations on the use and protection of water since it abstracts, uses, and discharges water during

01

its production processes.

European Directive No. 2000/60/EC of October 23, 2000, known as the Water

Framework Directive (WFD),

establishes a framework for a community water policy.

The WFD defines a framework for the management and protection of waters by major hydrographic basin at the European level. It plays a strategic and founding role in water policy, setting ambitious

objectives for the preservation and restoration of the condition of surface water (freshwater and

coastal

water)

and

for groundwater.

The main objectives of the directive are:

● achieving, starting in 2015, a good condition for all of these waters, which means a good ecological and chemical condition for surface water, as well as a good qualitative and quantitative condition for groundwater;

● adopting a combined approach of environmental quality standards (Directive 2008/105/EC of December 16, 2008) through removal of hazardous substances and emission thresholds based on the best available techniques, using the approach leading to the most stringent standards;

● immediately implementing this approach for priority hazardous substances for the Community, i.e., identifying them and establishing emission thresholds and quality standards for them;

● establishing a management plan for each hydrographic basin;

● taking into account the principle of recovering the costs of water-related services, integrating the polluter pays principle established by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;

● increasing public participation, through more and better information and involving the public

in decision-making.

Public authorities are also imposing strict regulations on industrial wastewater that may be discharged into collection systems and on treated wastewater and sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants.

The WFD set targets for 2015, but its implementation timetable runs until 2027. Discussions are still underway on

the issue of water, and on the reuse of domestic wastewater in particular. Better treatment of this water could significantly increase the use of wastewater, especially for agricultural irrigation.

General presentation of Renault Group

European Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of December 16, 2020, on the quality of water intended for human consumption aims to ensure high-quality tap water throughout the European Union. This directive is in response to the demands of over 1.8 million Europeans who signed the first-ever successful European Citizens’ Initiative, “Right2Water”, in support of improving access to safe drinking water for all Europeans.

In 2022, the European Commission drew up a watch list of substances and compounds of concern (2) for water intended for human consumption in accordance with Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The two substances in question are endocrine disruptors; we will take into account the transposition texts in each of the countries in which Renault operates in order to meet these new requirements. These requirements apply to the owners of

the water distribution networks (companies), among others. In addition, we will apply the new drinking-water quality standards. It is worth nothing that the theoretical time frame for transposing this Directive into local law is two years.

Lastly, the scarcity of water resources is a major issue for the coming years. India has already put in place obligations in this regard. In that country, domestic water must be treated and reused in toilets.

1.5.2.4. Waste management

European Directive 2008/98/EC of November 19, 2008, known as the Waste Framework Directive (WFD), defines the rules applicable to the treatment of waste within the European Union. It applies to all objects or substances that the holder discards or that he or she intends or is required to discard. The WFD reaffirms, in the name of the polluter pays principle, the responsibility of a waste producer to manage its waste in a way that does not endanger human health or harm the environment.

The Directive also introduces a requirement for waste producers to limit their impact on the use of resources by preventing and reducing waste with a view to

transitioning to a circular economy.

It establishes a hierarchy of waste treatment methods, requiring waste producers to prioritize, in the following order:

● waste prevention;

● preparation for its reuse;

● recycling;

● otherforms of recovery, in particular energy recovery;

● disposal.

It also clarifies the concept of recovery, disposal, end of status the

waste and by-products and

requires establishment of separate collections for paper, metal, plastic, and glass, as a minimum.

98

The Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of waste and its disposal, which was adopted on March 22, 1989, and entered into force on May 5, 1992, regulates and limits transboundary shipments of waste.

It

calls on

the 187 Parties to observe fundamental

as to disposal, principles such proximity

waste environmentally sound management, prioritize recovery, and prior informed consent to the importing of potentially hazardous substances, etc.

European Regulation (EC) 1013/2006 of June 14, 2006, on the shipment of waste transposes the principles of the Basel Convention into European law.

It requires the limitation of cross-border shipment of waste through observance of the principles of proximity and prioritization of recovery. To determine if transfer of waste is possible, and the

applicable procedure (communication or notification), the following need to be considered:

● the origin of the waste (country of production);

● the destination and route of the waste (transfer inside or outside the EU/EFTA/OECD);

● the type of treatment to be applied to the waste (recovery or disposal);

● the type of waste transferred:

● non-hazardous waste: green list (Annex III of the regulation);

● hazardous waste: orange

list (Annex IV of the regulation).

Under “extended producer responsibility” (EPR) regimes, producers who place waste-generating products on the market must take responsibility for management of that waste financially and/or operationally. This responsibility can be implemented through individual, shared, or collective systems (eco-organizations).

Several European directives have introduced this type of obligation for certain types of waste (sectors). In light of its activities, Renault Group is particularly concerned by regulations relating to household packaging, batteries

and accumulators (particularly for electric-vehicle batteries), end-of-life vehicles and lubricants.

Several new EPR schemes will be set up by 2025, with Renault Group being affected by the EPR scheme for industrial and commercial packaging.

Directive 2006/66/EC of September 6, 2006, on batteries and accumulators as well as battery and accumulator waste prohibits the marketing of certain batteries and accumulators with a mercury or cadmium content above a determined threshold.

In addition, it encourages a high level of collection and recycling for battery and accumulator waste as well as an improvement in the environmental performance of all actors in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, including during the recycling and disposal of battery and accumulator waste.

This Directive prohibits the landfilling or incineration of industrial and automotive battery and accumulator waste. Only their residues from both treatment and recycling may be landfilled or incinerated.

The net costs of collecting, processing, and recycling industrial and automotive batteries and accumulators must be paid by the producers.

Directive 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000, on end-of- life vehicles (ELVs) defines the measures to be taken to prevent and limit waste from end-of-life vehicles and their components, and to ensure that they are reused, recycled orrecovered.

Vehicle and equipment manufacturers must take into account the dismantling, reuse, and recovery of vehicles in the design and production of their products, limit the use of hazardous substances, and integrate an increasing share of recycled materials into vehicles.

The reuse and recycling rate for end-of-life vehicles must reach a minimum of 85% by weight per vehicle per year on average. The reuse and recovery rate must reach a minimum of 95% by weight per vehicle per year on average.

Producers (manufacturers or importers) must set up ELV collection systems, and owners may drop off their ELVs at

There is currently no need for producers to contribute to the economic balance of the sector, as the costs of processing ELVs is offset by the sale of stripped vehicles to approved shredders and parts and materials on the used vehicle, renovation and recycling market.

In and global environmental regulations have changed significantly over the last 20 years. Renault Group ensures that the regulations applicable to it are identified as soon as possible and taken into account in its production system. The European Union's Green Deal is a new European roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The policy is aimed notably at the circular economy and the preservation of resources and biodiversity, which are also central to the Group's concerns. Renault Group is therefore preparing to meet the new challenges by being vigilant and continuing to pursue an approach designed to continuously reduce its impact on the environment.

conclusion, European

Even though the European Union is still the leader in this area, countries like Korea, China, and India, which are strongly impacted by the scarcity of resources (water in particular) and increasing pollution (air and waste) are beginning to introduce more stringent regulations.

1.5.3 European regulations applicable to the distribution of new vehicles and spare parts

Renault Group is subject to European competition law. Among other things, this law prohibits agreements that prevent, restrict or distort

competition. By way of exception, agreements limiting competition (in particular through selection of resellers or provision for exclusive terms for them) are authorized when they may contribute to improving the production and distribution of products orto promote technical or economic progress.

The purpose

of

the European Commission's block exemption regulations No. 2022/720 of May 10, 2022, and No. 461/2010 of May 27, 2010, which are applicable to the distribution of new vehicles and the supply of spare automotive parts and to repair and maintenance services for motor vehicles, respectively, is to exempt from the prohibition of cartels, agreements presumed to improve distribution without eliminating competition.

The criteria for this automatic exemption depend on the market shares of the parties to an agreement (maximum threshold of 30%) and the absence of any marked restrictions on competition. As applied to the automotive

sector, this exemption is in principle applicable to the selection by manufacturers of their network of authorized distributors and repairers.

However, the presence of one of the following restrictions may prohibit the exemption from being applied:

● setting

the price or at which distributors can resell vehicles or spare parts (prohibition of resale price maintenance);

(fixed minimum)

● the distribution of geographic markets or customers between distributors (in particular, the restriction of passive sales in a reserved region or customer group);

● the ban on sourcing by authorized distributors from other authorized distributors (restriction of cross- deliveries);

● the ban on the resale by authorized distributors of spare parts to independent repairers for use in repair or maintenance services;

● the ban on the use by authorized repairers of spare parts of a quality equivalent to original parts for repair

or maintenance services.

Similarly, under regulation No. 461/2010, any restriction concerning access by independent repairers to the technical information

necessary

for the repair and maintenance of vehicles is presumed to exclude the benefit of exemption from the selection by Renault of its network of authorized repairers.

Regulation 2022/720 replaced Regulation 330/2010 on June 1, 2022. Accompanied by new guidelines, also adopted on May 10, 2022, it contains new provisions on e-commerce and the digital economy and updates the legal framework for distribution networks. The most substantial the

changes concern strict control information exchanges in the context of dual distribution (a system combining direct sales and resales through a

of

network of distributors), the reinforcement of the protection of selective distribution networks and the new flexibility in the duration

setting

of non-compete obligations. The exemption conditions in Regulation 461/ 2010 have generally been retained.

Regulation 461/2010 expires on May 31, 2023. Following public consultations held in 2022, the Commission published a new draft of Regulation 461/2010 for a period of five years from June 1, 2023, and new draft guidelines. The main purpose of the updates is to clarify that vehicle- generated data, which is considered essential input for the provision of repair and maintenance services, will be subject to the same rules on access, provision of tools and training as the technical information needed for repair and maintenance covered by the current framework.

1.5.4 Community design regulations

Council regulation (EC) No. 6/2002 of December 12, 2001, on community designs provides for the principle of the repair clause, which excludes the protection of visible spare parts of a vehicle via designs and models (repair clause principle) in order to promote free market competition by allowing any company to manufacture and sell spare parts on the after-sales market.

At the national level, European states remain divided over the transposition of the repair clause into national law. Some countries, such as Poland, Spain and Germany (since January 1, 2020), have transposed this clause. However, other countries such as France, Slovakia and Croatia refuse this deregulation and therefore do not apply the repair clause principle.

Nevertheless, in the long term, it is likely that the repair clause will become applicable to all EU countries. In the

summer of 2021, the European Commission launched a public consultation on the overall assessment of the design and model system with questions relating to the repair clause.

The extension of the repair clause to all European Union countries would have a significant economic impact on Renault Group’s after-sales market share.

France has

just taken a first step towards this liberalization by passing a law that, starting on January 1, 2023:

● removes copyright protection for spare parts;

● reduces the duration of protection of spare parts by designs to 10 years (instead of 25 years); allows equipment manufacturers to

1.5.5 Banking regulations

Several banking sector regulations applicable to Renault Group through its subsidiary RCI Banque are likely to have a significantimpact on its activities.

Directive 2013/36 of June 26, 2013, on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment companies, known as the “CRD IV Directive” was transposed in France by Order 2014/158 and by the Decree of November 3, 2014. These texts have redefined the rules governing the approval conditions for credit institutions, the governance of credit institutions, internal control and senior executive compensation, with the aim of harmonizing the

100

regulations applicable to credit institutions in these areas at European level. They are therefore an essential step towards the achievement of the internal market in the banking sector. Directive 2019/878 amended Directive 2013/36 as regards exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, compensation, supervisory measures and powers, and conservation measures. This

capital

directive was transposed into French law by Order No. 2020-1635 of December 21, 2020, bringing in a number of provisions adapting the legislation to European Union law on financial matters.

European Regulation 575/2013 of June 26, 2013, on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment companies, known as the “CRD IV Directive”, introduced new requirements for capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios. This regulation aims to strengthen the solidity of European banking institutions by improving the qualitative and quantitative aspects of capital. This text amended by regulation 2019/630 as regards the minimum coverage on

was

of losses non-performing exposures. This new regulation also supplements the existing prudential rules as regards capital with provisions for a deduction from capital if non-performing exposures are not

sufficiently covered by provisions or other adjustments. The CRD IV Directive was also amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of May 20, 2019, as regards the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities, counterparty credit risk, market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, large exposures, reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as Regulation (EU) 2020/873 of June 24, 2020, as regards certain adjustments to

in response

the Covid-19 pandemic.

Directive 2014/59

of

May 15, 2014, establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment companies, known as the out

“BRRD” set a the recovery and resolution of credit institutions. This text aims to ensure that bankruptcies of European banks are managed in such a way as to preserve financial stability and minimize costs for taxpayers. It gives the competent authorities the means to intervene before difficulties arise and, where necessary, at the start of the resolution process. The directive entered into force on January 1, 2015. These measures were supplemented by regulation 806/2014 of July 15, 2014, which established a single resolution mechanism (SRM) and a single resolution fund (SRF). Finally, this directive was amended by Directive 2019/879 of May 20, 2019, as regards the capacity to absorb losses and recapitalize credit institutions. This directive clarifies the fixing of the MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities each

framework for

specific to establishment) and was transposed into French law via Order No. 2020-1636

of December 21, 2020, on the

resolution regime in the banking sector.

Directive 2008/48 of April 23, 2008, on credit agreements for consumers was transposed in France by Law 2010-737 of July 1, 2010, on consumer credit reform. The purpose of these texts is to provide better consumer protection and to harmonize national credit distribution rules. These texts require credit institutions to strengthen consumer information by providing them with a standardized

Directive 2018/843 of May 30, 2018, amended Directive 2015/ 849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing. This text was transposed in France by Government Order 2020-115 of February 12, 2021. This system:

● strengthens the transparency of complex legal entities and legal structures by broadening access to registers of beneficial owners;

● sets out the enhanced due diligence measures to be implemented with respect to business relationships or transactions involving high-risk third countries;

● sets out the guarantees to be put in place to mitigate high money laundering risks associated with entering into a remote business relationship;

● establishes the principle of consolidated supervision of AML-CFT procedures by banking and insurance groups.

Directive 2016/97 of January 20, 2016, on insurance distribution, transposed in France by Decree 2018-361 of May 16, 2018, aims to ensure better consumer protection and harmonize national rules for the distribution of insurance products. This text requires the establishment of governance procedures for the design and distribution of insurance products and the delivery of a new standardized information document (IPID) to customers.

On February 25, 2019, the European Banking Authority published Outsourcing Guidelines (EBA/GL/2019/02). These guidelines forth a for

set governance framework outsourcing operations. Accordingly, they require an evaluation of each subcontractor, the keeping of a register of services outsourced, and the inclusion in contracts with subcontractors of a certain number of clauses to ensure good control of the risks associated with the outsourcing.

On January 18, 2017, the European Banking Authority published guidelines on the application of the definition of default (EBA/GL/2016/07). The purpose of this text is to harmonize the definition of default by providing a detailed clarification of the various reasons for default (including the counting of days in arrears), the conditions for a return to non-default and the associated processes. The text will be applicable starting January 1, 2021.

In addition, the European Commission has adopted the delegated regulation 2018/171 entitled "Final report on materiality threshold for credit obligation past due" (RTS/ 2016/06). This text introduces a unique methodology for the counting of days in arrears (Day past due counting) based on

the application of absolute and relative materiality thresholds.

In its Regulation 2018/1845 of November 21, 2018, the ECB set the absolute threshold at 100 euros for retail exposures and 500 euros for other exposures. These rules are to be complied with as of December 31, 2020.

Finally, the European Banking Authority also published guidelines for estimates of probability of default and estimates of loss given default(EBA-GL-2017-16).

Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance open a new chapter for their partnership:

Following approval by the Boards of Directors of Renault Group and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance today announced new initiatives to take their partnership to the next level.

A three-dimension program to maximize value creation for all Alliance stakeholders will include:

● High-value-creation operational projects in Latin America, India and Europe;

● Enhanced strategic agility with new initiatives that partners can join;

● A rebalanced Renault Group-Nissan cross-shareholding and reinforced Alliance governance.

Renault Group and Nissan have entered into a binding framework agreement regarding the above-mentioned transactions, with a view of reaching definitive agreements by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The transactions contemplated in these definitive agreements would be subject to a limited number of conditions precedent, including regulatory approvals, and completion is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023.

This far-reaching program paves the way for a renewal and strengthening of the 24-year partnership, creating a new agile spirit and harnessing the pioneering technologies of all three Alliance members. This next level will create more growth opportunities and help secure operating efficiencies for each Alliance company to innovate and transform in the fast- changing marketfor automotive products and mobility services.

Under it, Renault Group would transfer 28.4% of its Nissan shares into a French trust, where voting rights would be “neutralized” for most decisions, but where economic rights (dividends and proceeds from the sale of shares) would still fully benefit Renault Group until the sale of those shares. Renault Group and Nissan would retain a 15% cross-shareholding, with a retention obligation, as well as an obligation to cap their holdings. They would both be able to freely exercise the voting rights attached to their 15% working interest, with a 15% cap. Renault Group would instruct the trustee to sell these Nissan shares if the economic conditions are reasonable for Renault Group, in an organized and orderly process, but the trustee would have no obligation to sell its shares within a specific predetermined period. The Alliance Operating Board would remain the coordinating body.

This announcement has no impact on the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022.

Aramco signs letter of intent with Geely and Renault Group for new powertrain company to focus on lower emission technologies:

Aramco has signed a letter of intent to potentially become a minority shareholder in the new powertrain company (PWT) to be established by Geely Holding Group (Geely Holding), Geely Automobile Holdings Limited (Geely Auto HK.0175) - collectively referred to above as "Geely" - and Renault Group. The new company will focus on internal combustion and hybrid powertrain technologies.

Aramco's investment would be used to support the company's growth and contribute to research and development, particularly in synthetic fuel solutions and future generation hydrogen engines.

With a global network of 17 powertrain factories and five R&D centers on three continents, the future company will be a full- fledged global supplier with a total capacity of more than 5 million powertrains and engines, hybrids and plug-in hybrids per yearto supply further130 countries and regions.

2.1Creating economic, social and environmental value

2.1.1 Sustainable development strategy

The Group’s sustainable development action is based on three pillars. These three pillars support Renaulution’s transformation into a greener, more tech-intensive

company driven by data, energy and services:

● the first pillar, the environment, involves carbon footprint reduction and optimized use of resources through the development of our circular economy activities;

● the second pillar, safety, by leveraging the technology in our vehicles to improve the safety of users of our vehicles and services on the roads. This pillar also covers the safety of employees in the workplace; ● the third pillar, inclusion: the shift toward the new of electrification, data and the circular

businesses will

economy

be achieved by supporting

the

106

transformation of skills and promoting diversity within the Group.

“Carmaker and caremakers”: we make cars but also take care of those who design and build them and those who use them while limiting our impact on the planet we rely on to produce them.

This strategy is the result of a major collaborative and unifying process involving the Company’s management bodies, the Group Works Council and all employees worldwide (via an open global survey) as well as external stakeholder panels. A study on the company’s culture was also carried out at this time. The members of the Ethics & CSR Committee, now the Strategy and Sustainability Committee as well as the Board of Management were regularly informed of the progress of the work.

The 10 principles ofthe Global Compact

Launched by Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in July 2000, the Global Compact is a voluntary commitment framework by which companies, associations and non-governmental organizations are invited to respect 10 universally accepted principles affecting human rights, international labor standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. Each year, members must attest to the effective implementation of these principles in a “progress communication” report, which is posted on the Global Compact’s website.

Twenty-two years later, the United Nations Global Compact is the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative, bringing together more than 13,000 participants in 170 countries. Nearly 70 local networks around the world ensure a close relationship with members and national mobilization.

These 10 principles are inspired by:

02

● the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

● the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work;

● the International Labour Organization;

● the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;

● the United Nations Convention against Corruption.

The Global Compact is also the starting point for any organization seeking to support the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September 2015 by the UN. These goals offer a universal agenda to be achieved by 2030 to build a more sustainable and inclusive world.

Our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015 by the Member States of the United Nations, is an action plan designed to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all human beings live in peace and prosperity. It is structured around 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets that take into account the three aspects of sustainable development: the economy, social aspects and the environment. The latter are aimed at all stakeholders: States, local authorities, civil society, and economic and financial actors.

Through its geographical footprint, the diversity of its businesses and its commitment to ESG, Renault Group contributes – to a greater or lesser extent — to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals identified by the United Nations. This contribution is highlighted in the table below based on the targets the company has set and examples of actions. It should be noted that the Group contributes directly to SDGs 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 16.

2.1.4 Stakeholders and Materiality Matrix EFPD-B EFPD14c

Because dialog with our stakeholders enables us to better grasp environmental, social or economic challenges and risks, and makes us more agile in meeting their expectations, we have set up appropriate channels of exchange with each of them, at the global, regional or local level: customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, investors, local communities, associations and students.

In addition, Renault Group has set up a “Raison d’être” Committee. Chaired by Jean-Dominique Senard and made up of representatives of (most of) our stakeholders and certain members of the Leadership Team (formerly BoM) of Renault Group, the Raison d’être Committee sheds light on matters for the Board of Directors through its analyses and recommendations on environmental, social and societal issues.

Dialog with stakeholders also helped to develop the materiality matrix of ESG challenges.

Sustainable development

2.1.4.2. Renault Group materiality matrix: identification of material issues and ESG risks

At the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, Renault Group conducted a materiality analysis to identify and prioritize the environmental, social, societal and

governance issues it willface overthe next five years.

This analysis consists of crossing an internal vision of the importance of ESG (environment, social, societal and governance) topics the vision of

with external stakeholders in order to identify the “material” topics, those on which the Company must focus its efforts because they have a major impact on its ecosystem and its performance over the next five years.

This new materiality matrix updates the 2015 matrix and enables the Group to focus its strategy and environmental, social, societal and governance initiatives. Spearheaded by the

Sustainable Development Department, a group-wide steering committee supervised the methodological approach and the key stages of the project. This matrix was validated in January 2020 by the Group Executive Committee and by Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Methodological approach

The materiality matrix was defined by management representatives from the Company’s main departments/ functions, based on internal and external data.

The first stage of the process was to define the comprehensive list of ESG issues to which Renault Group is faced as a car maker and supplier of mobility services. Numerous sources were consulted to prepare this list, particularly the ESG rating criteria, competitors’ materiality matrices, press articles andinterviews with experts.

All of the issues collected were grouped into 14 coherent macro-issues. The importance of each issue along each axis ofthe matrix was then assessed.

The y-axis represents the influence on stakeholders’ opinions or behavior and classifies the issues according to the ESG expectations of the Group’s stakeholders. The importance of issues along this axis was determined from interviews with stakeholder representatives (employees, NGOs, suppliers, car dealerships, start-ups, researchers, public sector, investors) as well of

as a survey

3,500 customers in seven countries.

The x-axis illustrates the impact on the Company’s sustainable performance and represents the contribution of each theme to long-term value creation. To assess the importance of each issue along this axis, internal interviews took place with the Group’s

General Management, employees in the main departments/functions and an internal survey with 200 of Renault Group’s top managers.

120

The issues were then

refined

and placed on the materiality matrix during a collaborative workshop bringing together the representatives of the company’s main business lines/functions.

As in 2015, reducing the total carbon footprint and reducing the impact of the use of vehicles on air quality are Renault Group priorities. Internal and external stakeholders expect the Group to continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution due to road transport. They also assessed the impact of these two issues on Renault’s long- term sales performance as critical, notably due to tightened regulations and the decrease in the societal acceptability of vehicle emissions.

Similarly, Improving passenger and road user safety and Limiting the impact on resources particularly through the circular remain two

performance. These

Some issues increased in importance in the 2020 materiality matrix. One of the main changes compared with 2015 concerns stakeholder expectations (particularly

for investors and the public sector) on corporate governance. robust was

Guaranteeing be

governance considered to an essential prerequisite when undertaking any transformation of Renault Group and was, therefore, prioritized both in terms of stakeholder expectations and impact on Company performance.

In a context of changes in skill requirements (related to the electric vehicle, connected

and autonomous technologies, etc.) and growing employee expectations in terms of the environment and working methods, Ensuring employee well-being and development is also a growing issue for Renault. This expectation was also taken into account in the new sustainable development strategy with the creation of ReKnow University.

In response to the ongoing transformation of the mobility industry and the growing search for optimization of urban areas, the internal stakeholders expect the contribution of Renault Group to the transformation of urban mobility to a

have more significant impact on the Company’s performance than in 2015.

Stakeholder expectations concerning the Company’s actions on Ensuring respect for human rights and work throughout the supply chain were also reinforced compared with 2015.

2.1.5 Extra-Financial Performance Declaration

Renault Group prepares a detailed analysis of the risks to which the Company may be exposed, including the extra-financial risks that may call into question the Group’s ability to maintain its overall performance. The complete approach and comprehensive information on risks in general are presented in chapter 4 this Universal registration document.

2.1.5.1. Extra-financial performance reporting methodology

Regulatory context

In accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017, and Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017, of the French Commercial Code, Renault Group has established the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration (“EFPD”).

Identification of the main social,

societal

and environmental risks of the Group is based on international standards and norms – such as INERIS (National Institute for the Industrial Environment and Risks) and the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) – as well as internal mapping (Group major risks, corruption risks, pursuant to the provisions of the French “Sapin II” act, risks relating to the vigilance plan, as well as issues identified in the materiality matrix (see 2.1.4)).

Process of identification ofthe main extra-financial risks

Identification and summarizing of the principal risks with regard to the expectations of the EFPD were undertaken collaboratively, under the supervision of the Sustainable Development Department and the Risk Management

Department, with of the various

representatives departments and managers in charge of subjects coming within the scope of the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration, and notably:

● the environment;

● human resources;

● international social relations;

● purchasing and

relationships

with suppliers and subcontractors;

● health, safety, ergonomicsand the environment (HSEE);

● IS/IT;

● road safety;

● the development of new products and services;

● tax;

● legal affairs;

● ethics and compliance.

122 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

Renault Group also takes into account the United Nations Sustainable and market

Development Goals (SDG)

practices identified in its sector.

The Company has also taken into consideration the information listed in Article L. 225-102-1 (III) of the French Commercial Code. Certain topics have not been identified as pertinent principal risks in respect of the Group’s activities and shareholders’ known expectations, notably

those relating

to

food

(food waste, fighting food insecurity, respect for animal welfare and responsible, fair and sustainable food).

This list of risks was reviewed by the Strategy and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors.

Reporting principles

This work enabled identification of a list of 31 principal extra-financial risks grouped within the following five areas:

● social;

● societal;

● environmental;

● human rights;

● the fight against corruption and tax evasion.

Policies, procedures and the results of these procedures, including performance indicators, have been established for each of these risks.

The 31 principal risks were categorized as E for the main Environmental risks, S for Social and Societal and G for Governance and related to the issues in the materiality matrix (see table in 2.1.5.2 below).

Data collection process

Each indicator is associated with a coordinator, generally a business-line expert, who has collected, checked and consolidated the data within his/her reporting scope.

The indicators are then initially validated by the manager responsible for producing the indicator within his/her activity, then validated again by the manager of the entity concerned.

All

of the data is consolidated by the Sustainable

Development Department.

Reporting scope

The EFPD target scope is identical to that of Renault Group’s consolidated

financial reporting (see section 5.2.2.6, note 31 to the consolidated financial statements), namely Renault S.A., its subsidiaries and controlled entities (within the meaning of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code). When an indicator does not cover the entire scope, clarifications are provided with the indicator.

Details on the indicators that are included and excluded from the reporting scope can be found in section 2.4.2 and 2.6.1.3.

True and fair and verifiable data

Renault Group has voluntarily asked one of its statutory auditors to certify a selection of the environmental impacts of its main industrial, office and logistics sites since 1999. This verification is carried out with an

equivalent level of assurance to the financial data (reasonable assurance within the meaning of the IFAC’s ISAE 3000 for extra-financial verification). The indicators covered by the reasonable assurance report are listed in note 2.6.6.

02

In accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017, on the publication of extra-financial information by certain large companies and groups of companies, amended successively by Act No. 2018-771 of September 5, 2018, Act No. 2018-898 of October 23, 2018, and Act No. 2018-938 of October 30, 2018, Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017, to implement Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017, and the decision of September 14, 2018, amending the decision of May 13, 2013, the Group appointed an independent third party to verify the compliance of the EFPD (Extra-Financial Performance Declaration) and the accuracy of the information contained therein. This is

information

included in the Renault S.A. management report.

2.1.6 Taxonomy EFPD7b

02

The publication of information about the role that companies will have to play in mitigating and adapting to climate change

is currently expected the within framework of the European taxonomy. The Group is responding to these challenges by aiming for net zero by 2040 across Europe and by 2050 worldwide, adopting an approach which covers the entire life cycle of its vehicles.

The most diverse range of electric vehicles

The carbon footprint of vehicles in use accounted for nearly 80% of the Group’s carbon footprint in 2022. Thanks to the range of vehicles described below, the Group aims to achieve a reduction of up to -65% in Europe and -35% in

worldwide for emissions use (scope 3 downstream). Renault Group has a decade of experience in the design, manufacture, sale, and after-sale service of electric vehicles (EV). More than 30,000 Group employees worldwide have been trained in the considerations

specific to electric mobility, including the entire European sales network. Worldwide, there are more than 685,000 electric vehicles are on the road. In just over 10 years, the Group and the Alliance have already invested more than €10 bn in electrification. Thanks to these long-term efforts, the two brands Renault and Dacia have a total of 10 different models, from the Twizy small city car to the Master light commercial vehicle. In 2022, Renault

launched Megane E-Tech Electric, the first model of its “generation 2.0” of electric vehicles to benefit from the advantages of the Alliance’s CMF-EV platform, 100% “Made in ElectriCity”, Renault Group’s new industrial hub, one of the most competitive in Europe, located in northern France. In

2021, Dacia unveiled the most affordable electric vehicle on the market: Spring. This movement is accelerating: the Alliance will invest €23 bn over the next five years. Thanks to five common electric platforms covering most segments, the Renault brand aims to become 100% electric for passenger cars in Europe in 2030. In November 2022, Renault Group announced a new organization that will enable it to capture value from all the new profit pools by creating five targeted businesses, with specialized teams, each built on a uniform set of technologies, with its own dedicated governance and profit and loss accountincome statement:

● Ampere: the first electric and software pure player born out of the disruption of a traditional car manufacturer;

● Alpine: an exclusive, zero-emission, global brand with racing as its DNA. A unique asset-light model combined with proprietary technologies;

● Mobilize: built around a first-class financial captive to address the new mobility, energy, and data services market;

● THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL: the automotive industry’s first company dedicated to the 360° circular economy: from the closed loop of materials to battery recycling. This activity contributes to the objective of the transition to a circular economy of the European Taxonomy, which will be published later;

● Power: Renault Group’s traditional core business will continue to develop low-emission innovative combustion and hybrid vehicles under the Renault Dacia and Renault LCV (light commercial vehicles) brands, each with its own dedicated organization and governance.

Ampere: the first EV and software pure player originating from a manufacturer

With Ampere, Renault Group is creating an autonomous entity that will be the first electric and software pure player originating from a vehicle manufacturer. Ampere will develop, manufacture, and sell fully electric passenger cars with advanced SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will bring the best of both worlds: the know-how and assets of Renault Group with the focus and agility of a pure player in electric vehicles.

By 2030, Ampere’s range of 6 electric vehicles will be ideally positioned in the most dynamic segments in Europe covering 80% of the non-specialized electric market: in the B segment with the new Renault 5 Electric and Renault 4 Electric and in the C segment with Megane E-Tech Electric, Scenic Electric and 2 other vehicles to come. Much of the investment in the first 4 vehicles has already been spent.

Ampere aims to produce around 1 million EVs for the Renault brand by 2031.

Ampere relies on 3 technological pillars that make it unique in the EV and software ecosystem:

●

a high-tech and highly competitive manufacturing footprint: ElectriCity is already one of the largest and most competitive EV production centers in Europe. This involves three industrial sites in the north of France capable of producing and assembling more than electric vehicles – to

400,000 expandable 1 million – including batteries, using other Renault Group facilities. a unique local

ElectriCity also offers ecosystem with 80% of suppliers within a 300km radius;

● a European value chain for EVs: Ampere partners with the most relevant players to access know-how, ensure sustainable sourcing and gain visibility and control over costs and performance. Through its European supply chain, Ampere will provide more than 80 GWh needed for its cars by 2030. The value chain coverage of electric vehicles has increased from 10% in 2020 to over 30% and will reach 80% by 2030;

● Revolutionary Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) technology: SDV is the future of the automotive industry, as it allows the car to be constantly upgraded throughout its life cycle, to learn from its users and to remain linked to the manufacturer from the time it leaves the factory to the end of its life. It allows further progress to be made in terms of energy performance: the mass of the vehicle is reduced by transferring many functionalities from the hardware to the software, and the high level of integration allows advanced eco- driving aids to be provided.

Renault Group Sustainable development

Mobilize:

Built around

a leading financial services company to address the new mobility, energy and data markets

Mobilize is built around one key asset, Mobilize Financial Services (Mobilize F.S.), and is becoming a specialist provider of 100% electric Vehicles as a Service (VaaS), combining financial services mobility services including purpose-built vehicles, energy and data. These services, combined in a one-stop solution, will meet the needs of individuals, fleets and mobility operators.

Mobilize’s mission is to make mobility cleaner, shared, more accessible and more affordable.

● Electric vehicles have many advantages that make them not only an ideal choice for personal use, but also

the perfect vehicle for car-sharing. Renault has understood this, since nearly 12,000 of the brand’s electric vehicles are available for car-sharing every day in some twenty European cities, either on point to point with dedicated parking spaces or free-floating with no pick-up or drop-off points, such as Zity, which was first introduced in Madrid in 2017, in Paris in 2020 and then in Milan and Lyon in 2022.

The Group works across the entire value chain, and its efforts also focus on decarbonizing its supply chain (scope 3 upstream) and production factories (scopes 1 and 2).

A decarbonized industrial value chain

The Group is targeting a reduction of up to 30% in the carbon footprint per kilo of materials purchased by 2030 (scope 3 upstream) through a specific effort on steel, aluminum, tires, polymers and electronic components and up to a 35% reduction in the carbon footprint of its battery.

The upcoming application of an internal carbon price in our purchases of parts and materials will enable us to better manage this effort.

In addition to this responsible sourcing strategy, there are structuring partnerships such as with Envision AESC and Verkor for will low-carbon

batteries, which

be manufactured in France, with Valeo for rare-earth-free electric motors, also manufactured in France, Plug Power for hydrogen, Terrafame for nickel sourcing from Finland, Vulcan Energy for low-carbon lithium extracted from geothermal resources in Germany, and Managem for low- carbon cobalt sourcing from Morocco.

Partnerships have also been announced to accelerate the decarbonization plan for our production sites (scope 2):

● With Voltalia, the largest green electricity supply contract in France to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of its production activities in 2027 through the installation of photovoltaic panels;

132

● With

the ENGIE Group, a first-of-its-kind deep geothermal project in Europe that would replace 70% of the gas needs of the Douai factory by 2025;

● With Dalkia, EDF Group, a partnership to install a biomass boiler to replace 65% of the gas consumption at its Maubeuge plant;

These three strategic partnerships constitute a new step in the Global Climate Plan and will contribute to the net zero carbon objective for the factories of the ElectriCity division in France in 2025, in Europe in 2030 and worldwide in 2050.

Eligible activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy

All of the Group’s sustainable development efforts are now developed by Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2020,

on establishment of a the framework to facilitate sustainable investment within the European Union, known as “Taxonomy”.

For the 2022 financial year, the Group considers that, among its various industrial and service activities, the following activities are eligible for the taxonomy:

● Low-carbon manufacturing technologies for transport (taxonomy code 3.3), including activities such as the manufacture, repair, maintenance, adaptation,

repurposing, and sale of vehicles

● Transport by motorbikes,

passenger cars and commercial vehicles (taxonomy code 6.5), including the activities of purchasing, financing, renting, leasing and operating passenger and light commercial vehicles

These eligible activities concern both electric and combustion-engine vehicles; the Group thus complies with the “Commission notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets” (2022/C 385/01), published on October 6, 2022.

Within this scope, activities are considered to be aligned if they:

● make a substantial contribution to the objective of climate change mitigation, i.e. those relating to vehicles emitting less than 50 g of CO2e per kilometer, also referred to as “low-emission vehicles” in this section

● do not cause significant harm ("Do Not Significantly Harm" or DNSH) other environmental objectives: climate change adaptation, protection and sustainable use of water and marine resources, transition to a circular prevention and control, and economy, pollution

ecosystem biodiversity protection and restoration

● respect the Minimum Social Safeguards.

Expanding the scope of the taxonomy to include other environmental objectives will allow Renault Group to further develop its activities. The Group is thus ahead of the curve in terms of the circular economy, with the Refactory Flins and

in Seville in terms of battery recycling, reconditioning and electrical retrofitting of vehicles, and the creation of THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL.

Fulfillment of DNSH criteria

The methods used for the detailed verification of these criteria are described in the methodological note (see 2.6.1.1).

Renault Group complies with European regulation No. 1907/2006, known as "REACH", particularly in the use of chemicals known as "Substances of Very High Concern" (SVHC). The

DNSH criteria linked to the Pollution Prevention and Control goal go beyond “REACH” requirements by prohibiting the manufacture, placing on

the market and/or use of these substances, and even more

generally of all non-regulated substances called "Substances Of Concern" (SOCs), except if their “use has been proven to be essential for the society”. Such a requirement has not yet been precisely defined by the European authorities, and a many of these substances are currently needed to

produce the majority manufactured products while complying with current regulations. To date, we are unable to say whether the use of these SVHCs and SOCs is "essential for society", because of both the legal vacuum and the lack of evidence to support the use of SOCs, as there is no official comprehensive list and REACH requirements for them. We hope to be able to reassess our compliance with these DNSH criteria based on the definition of “essential use for the society” that will ultimately be adopted and the subsequent documentation that may be put in place on SOCs.

Compliance with Minimum Social Safeguards

Renault Group implements the procedures and tools necessary to ensure that legislative, regulatory and contractual rules are applied at the level of each group entity and that suppliers and subcontractors undertake to comply with them.

Renault Group is committed to key values, respect for human rights and ethical practices, and it contributes to the United Sustainable

Nations Development Goals

(SDGs) (see 2.1.3).

In addition, the Group's vigilance plan (see 2.2) implemented pursuant to the law of March 27, 2017, relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies is based on:

● risk mapping (identification, analysis and prioritization);

Substances in Annex XIV

Substances in Annex XVII

Renault monitors the use of these substances and stops to use them in its new projects at least five years before the ban, whenever an industrial solution exists. Where applicable, they comply with the applicable authorizations and restrictions

● a regular assessment of the situation of the Group and its subsidiaries with regard to the mapping of risks broken down by type of risk;

● the implementation of appropriate actions to mitigate risks or prevent serious harm;

● monitoring implementation measures and evaluating their effectiveness;

● an alert mechanism and collection of reports relating to the existence or occurrence of risks.

Consequently, we consider that the overall policy implemented both as an employer and as a car manufacturer is sufficiently solid so that, in the absence of indications of non-compliance, it is considered that the aforementioned rules are respected.

Sustainable development

Renault Group has noted the proposals of the Platform for Sustainable Finance to extend the minimum guarantees to be respected for the determination of alignment to new legal domains. However, given the fact that these are, to date, only recommendations and given the many legal uncertainties attached

to them, in particular on the consequences of non-compliance with these new rules, moreover underlined by the Platform in its report, Renault Group chose not to anticipate its implementation and to wait for all the CSRD and CSDDD texts to be definitively adopted.

Key performance indicators for aligned activities

Turnover The definition of turnover in the EU taxonomy corresponds to turnover as reported in the IFRS consolidated financial statements, which totaled €46.4 bn for the 2022 financial year (see 2.6.1.1).

Ofthis total:

2

134

● €41.7 bn, or 89.8% of the Group’s turnover, is attributable to economic activity 3.3 (Low-carbon technologies for transport) contribution to climate change mitigation. On this perimeter, are respected:

● €3.2 bn, or 7.0% of the Group’s turnover, is attributable to economic activity 6.5 (transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles)

and classified as eligible for the taxonomy. This represents a total of €44.9 bn, or 96.8% of the Group’s turnover

Of these receipts, €5.2 bn meets the selection criteria used to measure the substantial contribution to

climate change mitigation. This includes all revenues generated by our electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrids (PHEV), which account for 11.3% of total Group turnover.

Due to a prudent interpretation of the DNSH requirements relating to the pollution prevention and control objective (see 2.6.1.1), the aligned turnover is declared nil. However, 9% of our sales of low-emission vehicles2

comply with:

● the European environmental

regulations in force, including those covering the use of substances;

● the criteria concerning

DNSH the environmental objectives of adaptation to climate change, protection and sustainable use of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy and protection and restoration of the biodiversity of ecosystems and

● minimum social safeguards.

Investments

According to the definition given by the Taxonomy (see 2.6.1.1), the Group's investments (Capex) amounted to €4,231m for the 2022 financial year.

Of this total, 100% is attributable to economic activity 3.3 (Low-carbon technologies for transport) and classified as eligible for the taxonomy.

Of these Capex, €836m, or 19.8% of the total amount meet the selection criteria used to measure the substantial

● European environmental regulations;

● the concerning

DNSH criteria the environmental objectives of adaptation to climate change, protection and sustainable use of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy and protection and restoration of the biodiversity of ecosystems;

● minimum social safeguards.

Taking into account all the DNSH criteria the aligned Capex amounted is €476m, or 11.2% of the Group's total Capex.

In accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2007 (UNDRIP) and local regulations in terms of property rights,

● Renault Group works to minimize potential negative impacts and encourage positive impacts of its projects on local communities and indigenous peoples. In particular, the safety of its employees and facilities must not be exercised at the expense of respect for the human rights of local communities and indigenous peoples.

● Renault Group develops activities with a positive impact and involving all stakeholders in the territories, and on each site where the Group has a significant weight and influence on its immediate environment, it aims to establish a development plan for local communities and indigenous populations based on a precise analysis of impacts. In addition, in accordance with the 2019 Global Framework Agreement, employees who wish to become with associations and involved solidarity-based

enterprises have specific arrangements, in compliance with local laws, for the time spent on these activities.

2.2.2 Human rights and fundamental freedoms EFPD17 EFPD18

2.2.2.1. Risk mapping: identification, analysis and prioritization

Methodology

As part of its duty of vigilance, Renault Group has drawn up a mapping of the risks that its own activity poses to women and men in terms of human rights.

The methodology adopted is part of the same system as the Group’s major risk management system. The last update was in 2022.

Ten risks were identified, analyzed and prioritized by specialists from six departments: Human Resources, Ethics & Compliance, Purchasing, Prevention & Protection, Sustainable Development and Risk Management. This risk map was then presented to the Group Human Resources Department, who validated it and the

associated action plan.

This mapping is based on:

● a list of risks resulting from a benchmark carried out

with industrial companies in the automotive, food processing, luxury goods, energy and transport sectors;

● a process for analyzing alerts (see 2.2.6.1 Whistleblowing tool);

● monitoring of the social, economic and regulatory context of the regions in which the sites are located. watch has set on

A been up

human rights and fundamental freedoms;

● reports published by the ILO, which may go beyond just the rights identified in the global framework agreements.

2.2.2.2. Procedures for regular assessment ofthe situation of the Group and its subsidiaries based on the risk mapping

The assessment of the situation of the Group and its subsidiaries in view of the risk mapping is based on two pillars:

● Local audits to monitor the implementation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms policies defined in the Global Framework Agreements as well as in section 2.2.1. of this document. 89.6% of the Group's employees are covered by a collective agreement at branch and/or company level. The Internal Audit Department includes knowledge of and compliance with global framework agreements in its local audits of practices. In the event of any

human resources difficulties

arising,

a

memorandum

application

concluded in January 2018 with the signatories of the

2013 framework agreement constitutes a genuine action guide for dealing with them under joint responsibility.

● In the event of an alert, a formalized handling process (see section 2.2.6.2). Any alerts are the subject of a specific item at the plenary sessions of the Renault Group Committee (RGC). In 2022, this meeting was held on September 30 with all members of the RGC. The RGC has 40 members, representing 26 countries, and is the preferred forum for open and responsible international social dialogue. In 2022, as in 2021, the Group has not received any feedback from the parties to the global framework agreements.

Diversity and Inclusion

In addition to the risk mitigation and prevention measures listed in this table, Renault Group has set itself ambitious targets for diversity and inclusion.

02

This Renault Group Diversity and Inclusion Plan is based on four pillars, the last one being specific to gender representation:

● Ensure fair and respectful treatment of all;

● Promote an inclusive work environment;

● Facilitate the integration and development of all in the company;

● Increase the representation of women at all levels, in all professions and in all countries where the company operates.

By 2030, Renault Group aims to have 30% women in management positions.

In this context, Renault Group is implementing actions in several areas:

● Gender diversity: Renault Group is committed to implementing specific measures regarding the position of women in the company, which results in an evolution of its HR processes in terms of recruitment and career management and in the development of an international network of women;

● Disability: Renault Group facilitates the integration of the individuals with disabilities within the Group by implementing specific integration measures, installing adapted workstations, and actions for communication and raising awareness among employees. In 2022, the Group signed the ILO Disability Charter;

● Origin: Renault Group promotes cultural and social diversity within its teams in all the countries in which it operates;

● Age: Renault Group ensures balance between generations and supports its employees throughout their professional life. It draws on the experience, training and know-how of seniors while providing training and ensuring integration of young people in the workforce. In 2022, Renault Group, along with 30 other companies, signed a charter on the employability of people over 50 years old covering ten key commitments.

2.2.2.4. A system to monitor measures taken and assess their effectiveness

The Duty of Vigilance Steering Committee monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the Ethics and Compliance Committee once a year (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).

The effectiveness of measures is principally determined in light of the number of incidents reported by signatory parties to Global Framework Agreements resulting in the implementation of the measures provided for in the 2018 memorandum. We can note that in 2022, as in 2021, no incident was to measurement within

subject

Probable

This mapping is based on:

● principally based on external benchmarks;

● statistical analysis of the accidents, occupational illnesses and malicious acts that occurred over the past 10 years at Group sites (see 2.2.3.2. and 2.2.3.4.);

● knowledge of the variety of activities at industrial, tertiary and testing sites;

● monitoring of the social, economic, environmental and safety situation in the Group sites’ host regions.

The risk prioritization presented in this matrix is the result of comprehensive analysis of risks assessed at each Group site. For example, the risks of malicious acts are highly dependent on the security situation and the socioeconomic ethos surrounding each site, whereas safety risks will vary depending on the type of activities at each site (vehicle assembly, engineering, sales, etc.). To manage these risks, the functional departments HSEE (Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Environment) and D2P (Prevention & Protection Department) utilize amongst other things mappings of each site.

Each site’s situation is assessed based on four pillars:

● coaching on the basis of the Mandatory Rules and associated Key Requirements of the various HSEE areas

(HSEE in projects, safety, burn and asphyxiation prevention, ergonomics, industrial

hygiene,

and

environment);

● site self-assessments;

● audits by corporate or by teams composed of members of the HSEE network and members of corporate to align the levels ofrequirements;

● analyses of the frequency rates of occupational accidents and diseases.

These regular assessments are carried out during field audits and are supplemented by detailed analyses of the results of accidents and occupational diseases.

They feed into the Group’s HSEE strategy and allow it to be adapted if necessary.

2.2.3.2.2. Security: risks of malicious acts

A questionnaire to self-assess the security management system is circulated every year to all Group sites. This assessment is part of internal control procedures. The Group began automating these questionnaires in 2022 with a view to optimizing analysis of results.

If an instance of non-compliance is observed, the Group’s Prevention and Protection Department helps the relevant site create and implement a corrective action plan.

2.2.3.3.2.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics

As part of Renault Group’s commitment to health and safety, a dedicated department was created in September 2016, reporting directly to the Executive Committee. The commitment of the HSEE Department and Renault Group was reflected in the signing of a Health and Safety policy by the Group HR Director and CEO.

Our objective is “zero accidents and occupational illnesses” by 2030. We have established a strategic roadmap which shows how we will progress to this ambitious objective.

To address risks, the company has established qualitative references

namely

Mandatory Rules and Key

Requirements which cover health, safety, ergonomics, burns and asphyxiation in projects and serial life.

We are in the planning stages of implementing ISO45001 with 25 HSEE managers already trained by AFNOR and 1 site (Bursa in Turkey) already accredited which we will use as a reference.

The internal control department have implemented a dedicated procedure to check the effectiveness of the health, safety and ergonomics management system.

2.2.3.3.3. Communication

The HSEE department communicates monthly and widely (to more than 1,000 people of various functions and hierarchical levels) the statistical results and progress of all the approaches within its scope. This communication includes information from the HSEE Department (results, new standards, new technologies, projects, etc.), information from regional HSEE coordinators, and site publications in order to share widely the good practices deployed.

A "club métier" is organized for each of the HSE domain and gathers monthly all the network members to exchange on new initiatives and track their progress, to share good practices …

2.2.3.3.4. Project Management

2.2.3.3.4.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics

The HSEE project team has developed its 5 Mandatory Rules regarding HSEE in projects and 22 associated Key Requirements (5MRs/22KRs), which have been integrated into the company’s quality management system. The contributing business lines have been identified, and training has been carried out to ensure that actor implied in projects knows the 5MRs/22KRs.

Sustainable development

2.2.3.3.4.2. Security Each project is monitored by the Group’s Prevention and Protection Department (D2P). At each project milestone, D2P identifies the risks and determines the measures associated with them, along with adequate budgets.

2.2.3.3.5. Training

2.2.3.3.5.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics

Employee awareness and skills are among the main drivers ofthe overall HSEE strategy. To raise awareness of health

and safety among employees and to ensure the necessary skills, a three- tiered training program has been defined:

Tier 1 – HSE basics with training such as: SWI (Safety Workstation Induction) training, virtual reality hazard hunt, new hire induction, general introduction to HSEE Mandatory Rules, safety dojo, and accident management.

Tier 2 – established qualifications with external training courses conducted by recognized training organizations such NEBOSH and

as: ISO 45001 AFNOR (French standardization committee) on management systems, CMSE® on machine safety and the CNPP for the Fire Safety – Fire Investigation Methodology.

Tier 3 – specific theme-based and/or technical training covering HSEE specific subjects to certain employees may be exposed based on their activity such as LOTO (Lock–Out Tag–Out – identification and blocking of energy), electric vehicles, machine safety, chemical safety, using tackle equipment, operating handling equipment, and ergonomics.

In addition to training provided at corporate level, sites are also very involved in training processes addressing their specific needs.

Video simulations deriving from specific risks identified through some accident investigations are produced to raise awareness. Since 2019, 21 such simulations have been created and shared at various levels the

of company. Once the appropriate risk control measures have been identified, they are summarized and shared in

a transversal memo, and the deployment of the associated action plans is monitored monthly. To date, 30 transversal memos have been or are being deployed and progress is tracked on a regular basis.

2.2.3.3.5.2. Security

The Group’s Prevention and Protection (D2P) Department has a Safety School providing training to Prevention and Protection (D2P)

employees and all Renault Group employees. Specific courses are available in use of video surveillance and in the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (notably the use of dangerous goods to commit malicious acts).

All malicious acts are analyzed by the site teams and D2P experts to provide feedback and, if necessary, training for

148

employees working in security or human resources, communication, general management, etc.

An e-learning course to raise awareness of malicious acts will be rolled out to all Group employees in 2023. D2P also leads crisis drills

to train management committees in methods and best practices to manage this kind of situation.

2.2.3.3.6. Further risk mitigating initiatives

2.2.3.3.6.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics

Psychosocial disorders

Renault Group clearly affirms its commitment to well- being and mental health in the Health and Safety at Work Policy signed in 2021.

A Mandatory Rule is dedicated to mental health. It was defined in partnership between the HSEE Department, the medical coordinators, and the HR function. Its deployment was initiated in 2022 at industrial and commercial sites. Some ten committees for the promotion of psychological

health

and well-being

at work

have been set up. Committee members receive dedicated training to gradually roll out the approach.

Chemical-induced accidents and illnesses

● The industrial hygiene team works on a daily basis to control worker exposure to hazardous substances and chemical

compliance covering CLP/GHS/REACH regulations and to reduce the number of the most hazardous chemical substances used at Renault Group

sites, including products containing carcinogenic, mutagenic, and reprotoxic substances and endocrine disruptors. Since 2010, we have eliminated or avoided the use of approximately 758 chemicals, including 272 in 2022, in particular many paints containing cumene. This reduction made it possible to achieve the Group's objective of -20% between 2016 and 2022. Following on from the measures to replace the most hazardous substances, we have now committed to reducing their number by 50% by 2030.

● In view of the results of the self-assessments on the 8 Mandatory Rules / 60 associated Key Requirements in Industrial Hygiene of 2021 and the seriousness of the potential consequences for health, a priority action program was established and rolled out incrementally throughout 2022 with a monthly follow-up on their progress and verification of their implementation by the DHSEE, Particular emphasis was placed on the posts where the most toxic substances are handled or emitted with the provision of a training kit to raise the

awareness of operators at these workstations both about the risks and about the importance of all the protective measures implemented.

● The first internal audits on these 8 Mandatory Rules were conducted in 2022.

● Training in

the regulations on the

transport dangerous goods was also provided, with almost 120 people trained, mainly to support Li-ion battery projects.

Specifically regarding Covid prevention

02

Even though the risk of Covid is not intrinsically associated with the Group’s activities, the Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Environment (HSEE) Division and the medical teams have set up a Covid risk management system for all Group sites. This system, which was certified by AFNOR (French standardization committee) in January 2021, has prevented the formation of large clusters since the beginning of the crisis. It is based on rules and instructions (70 HSE operating standards) dealing with topics such as the correct way of wearing a mask, disinfecting shared equipment, aerating rooms, dealing with people presenting symptoms, the psychosocial aspects of Covid, etc. These rules and instructions are circulated to all sites through regular committee meetings. While the current trend is to ease health measures, the HSEE Department continues to define the pace of relaxing these measures on a weekly basis, country by country, based on the health situation and local regulatory developments.

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD): Ergonomics During 2022, the Ergonomics Department supported 19 new vehicle projects with a focus on inherent ergonomics design. In parallel, the new ergonomic management system, which consists of three pillars (Ergonomics memorandum, Ergonomics evaluation method and Ergonomics Mandatory Rules), has been defined and deployed for all industrials sites and engineering.

1. Ergonomics memorandum

The Ergonomic memorandum is a reference guide that encompasses standard ergonomic principles, adapted to all fields of activity. Six specific ergonomics memoranda have been finalized and deployed: bodyshop, assembly shop, paintshop, stamping, logistics, metal bodywork, and sales & aftersales.

2. Ergonomics evaluation method (M2E)

The new workstation ergonomics assessment is now deployed in all industrial sites. The aim is to perform in- depth risk assessments, in order to define action plans to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and thus the number of days lost. Since 2021, a training plan for the network of human factors experts has been deployed. A self- assessment of industrial sites is underway: All supervisors were trained by ergonomics experts in the factory, and 21,983 workstations were evaluated.

3. Ergonomics Mandatory Rules

The key criteria and experience gathered from all works have consolidated

previous

been into six Mandatory Rules. Each industrial site conducted its self- assessment over the first half of 2022. Formal audits began in the second half of the year with 2 audits in France.

All these specifications are used upstream in projects to avoid the introduction of new ergonomic strains whilst simultaneously applied in production runs to enhance working conditions.

Risks related to logistics and internal traffic activities

● In 2022, the HSEE department, in collaboration with the site and central logistics departments, continued to improve the tools and standards developed previously, including a memorandum on traffic (compilation of applicable rules), a risk assessment method “Safe Site,

Safe Vehicle, Safe Driver” (SSSVSD), a pallet truck memorandum and a Safety Compliance Check on vehicle resources.

● The sites conducted out a “Safe Site, Safe Vehicle, and Safe Driver” (SSSVSD) self-assessment allowing them to evaluate their level of compliance with the rules and prioritize their prevention actions.

● Renault

is continuing its

collaboration with the Association of European Vehicle Logistics (ECG) to reduce the number of accidents when delivering cars. Renault plays an active role in working groups, specifically on

accident analysis, safe loading/ unloading processes, and delivery site safety.

Accidents with machinery

● Tools and procedures have been developed to identify and mitigate machine-related risks. These include, to name a few, essential safety requirements for suppliers, inspection reports, and the safety compliance check for the approval of new facilities. Tools such as the “machine interaction”

application help move

to towards safe conditions for interaction with machines.

● The production run machine safety inspection process, launched in 2021, has resulted in 4,403

addition inspections in 2022.

● The monthly workshop managers’ meeting initiated in 2020 continues and brings together site health and safety managers and machine maintenance experts. Various more or less technical machine safety topics are covered.

● 6 sites were prioritized in 2022 for inspections and coaching by corporate machine safety specialists.

Burns and asphyxiation

● The HSEE

Department

and the Prevention have introduced a

and Protection Department

new procedure to ensure the safety of work involving hot spots (fire permits), such as welding or cutting with a blowtorch. This “fire permit” is established in order to prevent the risk of fire and explosion caused by hot spot work. Feedback on this new procedure has been positive and the number of fires caused by hot-spot work has decreased since then. The fire tracking procedure deployed in mid-2020 ensures this new fire permit is effective.

Sustainable development

● In 2022, the network was trained in the “6 Mandatory Rules for preventing burns and/or asphyxiation” and 57 associated Key Requirements. The sites have started their self-assessments. These enable them to assess their level of compliance with the rules and to prioritize the preventive actions to be implemented.

Risk associated with electrical vehicles

● The HSEE dimension has been strengthened in new electric and hybrid vehicle projects from the product and process design stage in order to make the work of factory operators and after-sales technicians safer.

● Safety is integrated upstream in the design of the product by standard solutions like safe design of high voltage batteries, by electrical lockout/tagout procedure for safe assembly and maintenance on each vehicle. All the players involved in these projects have been trained. The safety training program is updated periodically with the support of certified organizations (e.g. APAVE or Bureau Veritas). The theoretical part of the training

program was supplemented by several practical exercises. It incorporates more practice with a specific Dojo (safety school) focused on hazard characterization and the implementation of safety rules.

● The new training program is already implemented at several major sites (Douai, Maubeuge, Cléon, Pitesti, Valladolid, and Palencia). Deployment has continued through our Manufacturing Academy and Renault Academy. In Manufacturing, more than

3,000 employees have been trained since 2020, including 1400 in 2022.

● In the scope of transportation and concerning the EV battery, guidelines and training sessions on regulatory requirements for suitable packaging, test of battery before transportation, were

implemented by the internal Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor.

Management of safety of external companies and concurrent activities

The deployment of a dedicated contractor management tool (CMT) allows us

to manage

contractors and contractors’ activities working at our sites. Six key elements are integrated in the procedure:

1. Support Renault

Business

Managers in drafting Prevention Plans;

2. Define a pre-selection process for subcontractors from an HSE perspective;

3. Ensure that the subcontractors involved are trained and competent before they arrive on site and that all the necessary authorizations are available and up to date (administrative, technical, etc.);

4. Assess risks prior to any activity and establish control measures to eliminate or minimize risks;

5. Monitor and supervise the work, report HSE problems that need to be corrected, and evaluate the HSE performance of subcontractors to be included in the pre-selection process (refers to point 3.);

6. Have a constantly updated map of all work for a better view of concurrent activities.

All HSE managers of French sites and their teams (except RRG) have been trained to use the platform. They have started to train their business managers.

2.2.3.3.6.2. Security

Malicious acts on site

The rules on access control were updated in early 2022. The status of persons with the right to access our facilities was reviewed. Regarding cyber risks, the Security Master Plan was updated and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR) in 2021.

Digital malicious acts or threats

● Training courses in information protection and cyber risks

are provided on several platforms including e-learning (a new e-learning course was introduced in 2021), French Home Office information sessions, and targeted training courses.

● In order to raise awareness of personal data protection among all the Group’s employees, an e-learning course was rolled out in 11 languages in 2020 required for all new employees.

2.2.3.4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness

The Duty of Vigilance Steering Committee monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the Ethics and Compliance Committee once a year (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).

2.2.3.4.1. Health, Safety and Ergonomics

HSEE is building its digital expertise

The DHSEE is going digital with a variety of applications managing, for example, the reporting of occupational accidents and illnesses, alerts and analysis of root causes, the management of chemical products, the evaluation of movements and postures, the management of external companies, as

well and as regulatory monitoring compliance. Eventually, these tools will cover all aspects of HSEE. Digitalization helps to measure the effectiveness of the measures implemented.

Statistical evaluation to complement field evaluation

To ensure that no aspect of health and safety is overlooked, it is necessary to correlate the results of risk Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2022 financial year assessment in the field (results of audits of the 10 Mandatory Rules on safety) with accident frequency

rates. These statistical analyses are all the more important as audit activity has been reduced in recent years due to Covid and the subsequent component crisis. Nevertheless, a total of 26 10MR/74KR audits (including 11 factory audits) were conducted in 2022, bringing the total number of audits conducted since 2017 to 353.

After a significant reduction of the FR15 the Group decided ,

to change the main indicator of accidents at work to FR25 (lost-time accidents) in 2021. The objective is to rapidly reduce the FR2, while maintaining a stable FR1, thanks to allthe HSE measures initiated.

The Group also promotes the reporting of low-severity (first aid) accidents and continues to improve the reporting process, even in countries where reporting is not mandatory. No targets are set to encourage their reporting. They do not appear in the graph below.

The combination of preventive and corrective actions described above has resulted in a reduction of the FR2 from a high of 3.7 in 2018 to 1.70 in 2022. It should be noted that the Group’s performance in 2022 was maintained despite the exit of the Russian sites, which significantly affected the FR1 and FR2 statistical results. Their results were significantly weaker than the Group’s results.

At the same time, the percentage of compliance with the 10 Mandatory Rules on safety/74 Key Requirements of factories contributors to

(biggest and accidents occupational diseases) increased from 57.4% in 2018 to 65.2 at end-2022. These developments demonstrate the effectiveness ofthe strategy implemented.

The trend is therefore encouraging and is moving towards the Group’s goal of zero lost-time accidents by 2030, with an intermediate step of 1.0 expected in 2025.

It should also be noted that there have been no deaths of Renault employees or temporary workers since 2018 in the current Renault Group scope.

These frequency rates do not include subcontractor accidents at the Group’s sites. It is not always easy to obtain information on these accidents, as the injured do not always visit the infirmary of the sites, especially when the injuries are not serious. This is why the DHSEE has defined a threshold of injury severity above which external companies must report accidents to Renault. The number of such accidents has steadily decreased since 2017, with 16 accidents above this threshold for staff from external companies, compared with 3 in 2022.

(√) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance forthe 2022 financial year.

The graph above shows the data on occupational illnesses reported for Renault employees only. After investigation by the authorities, some of these illnesses are not attributed to Renault, but they are not subtracted from the reported data.

The steady downward trend in the occupational disease rate was interrupted in 2020. The process of reporting occupational diseases in Romania, simplified at the end of 2019 and therefore in place throughout 2020, explains the trend reversal. Romania also impacted the Group's results in 2022, as COVID-related hospital access restrictions in 2021 led employees to delay reporting in 2022.

Furthermore, the removal of the Russian sites from the

Renault Group scope also negatively affected the indicator because these sites had few occupational illnesses but represented many hours.

About 80% of occupational illnesses are musculoskeletal disorders, and 20% are related to historical exposures. In order to meet the Group’s ambition of Zero Occupational Illnesses, a selection of Key Requirements among the Mandatory Rules in ergonomics and health have been prioritized and are subject to reinforced monitoring.

The DHSEE includes in this category of events any lost- time accident occurring on the public highway, for example, between the workplace and home, between the workplace and a supplier’s site, or between home and a supplier’s site.

Traffic accidents occurring within the geographical coverage of Renault sites are monitored as part of the workplace accident frequency rate.

In countries where information on traffic accidents is passed on to the employer, Renault Group uses such data to draw up action plans, awareness-raising initiatives, training, etc.

These actions include awareness-raising, specific communications, and employee training to reduce the number and severity of commuting accidents, regardless of the means of transport used (car, motorized two- wheelers, bicycle, scooter, pedestrian).

326 traffic accidents were reported in Renault Group in 2022, 167 of which resulted in lost time. Car accidents are in the majority and account for (40%) and two-wheelers (motorized + non-motorized) 29%.

Of the 12,022 days lost due to traffic accidents in 2022, 6907 were due to accidents that occurred in 2022, and the remaining 5,115 were due to accidents that occurred before 2022.

Group absenteeism EFPD2b

The rates vary greatly from one country to another, particularly because of the extent of social security coverage (whether provision is covered by public bodies or not). The rates changed very differently in 2022 compared with 2021, depending on the impact of the health crisis in the different countries. Overall,the increase remains limited, with a rate of 3.39% in 2022 compared with 3.21% in 20216 .

02

The absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is calculated on the basis of the average monthly workforce and the yearly theoretical number of working days. The number of days of absence is expressed in working days, excluding days of furloughs, layoffs, strikes, training and leave (including maternity and paternity leave). An explanation of the calculation method is available in appendix 2.6.2.

2.2.3.4.2. Security

Fire hazard

Every outbreak of fire is reported within 24 hours to the Group’s Prevention and Protection Department and is analyzed using a cause tree approach. A summary is prepared every month and circulated to all field operations teams.

Renault Group pays particular attention to training employees in using fire extinguishers and in evacuating buildings if a fire alarm is sounded.

If the incident may be of interest to other sites, a flash alert (warning) requiring particular vigilance and safety measures is sent out within 72 hours.

It contains 6 boxes: circumstances of the fire, damage and losses, causes, corrective/preventive actions plan, ATEX (explosive risk reminder and

atmospheres) recommendations for all sites.

Risk of a malicious act on site

The Group’s Prevention and Protection Department relies on

a system to report alerts. Site security managers around the world are required to forward an analysis of each malicious act occurring in their scope, within 24 hours, via a formal tool. Each act is analyzed with D2P and a corrective action plan is implemented when and as required. D2P produces a monthly summary in particular to analyze impacts on people, and to update the risk mapping, rules and processes accordingly. The monthly

report is presented to

the D2P Director. Specific instructions may be provided, depending on the events, in order to better protect our employees. In the event of a particular risk, a flash alert prescribing particular

prevention and protection measures may be sent to the relevant sites.

Risk of a malicious act off site

D2P has digital tools to track travelers and expatriates and send them information in real time. It carries out a thorough analysis of incidents each year, with our medical assistance and international security service provider. No significant incidents affecting people was reported in the past three years.

Digital malicious act or threat

To monitor Renault Group’s compliance with regulation on personal data, performance indicators are generated on a monthly basis and on request.

operations is currently being treated.

2 Air pollution: bodywork painting in particular releases of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) that may impact health if not controlled.

associated with 3 Greenhouse gas emissions: these are principally energy consumption at sites and encompass direct emissions from internal facilities that consume gas and indirect emissions from the production of the electricity used. These air emissions have an impact on climate change.

Detailed method for mapping environmental risks on sites

The sites with the most significant environmental impacts have an ISO 14001 certified environmental management system.

In this case, the previous assessment is completed with in- depth environmental analysis carried out using Ecorisques, an IT tool. This tool uses a qualitative approach (context, risk potential, level of control over it) and a quantitative approach (noise, natural resources, waste, emissions, wastewater, chemical risks) to assess and organize into a hierarchy the risks and possible impacts arising from the site’s activities with a view to taking remedial measures.

Since 2021, a new in-house tool for mapping major risks has reinforced this approach at all of the Group’s sites (industrial, logistics, engineering and dealerships): the Mandatory Rules (MR) and the associated Key

Requirements.

This is a reference system containing all the identified critical risks and providing a key to score each site in relation to these risks, in a prioritized and systematic manner. This in-house reference system developed in 2020 draws on more than 20 years of feedback from experience from experts at the Corporate Environment Department. It covers the main families of risks discussed above and the 50 key risks, providing a precise description of the various levels of criticality associated with each risk, which serve as a basis for each site’s self-

assessment.

The resulting mapping undergoes a shared approval process and conclusions are shared among Corporate and site management.

2.2.4.2. Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of the Group and its subsidiaries based on the risk mapping

The process to assess the situation of sites on a regular basis in light of the risk mapping discussed in chapter 1 relies on self-evaluations and on-site audits. It is depicted in the flowchart below. The assessment of the situation of all sites the or

(industrial, logistics,

engineering dealerships) is updated on a regular basis. The objective is to update assessments every year and conduct internal

audits at 100% of sites over a 3-year rotating schedule (the cycle started at end-2021). At the sites with the most

significant environmental

impacts,

the in-depth environmental analysis completing this assessment is updated whenever a project

that entail

may

environmental impacts or risks is undertaken, and at least every 3 years.

2.2.4.3. Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements EFPD7b

At large sites potentially involving more significant environmental

impacts, the action plan is a key component of the Environmental Management System and an organization endowed with specific resources is tasked with running and updating the system on a regular basis. Once the impacts and risks are known, these sites roll out an action plan aimed at preventing and reducing the identified potential harm to the environment.

This approach was reinforced in 2021 for all sites by the mapping of major risks developed through the rating of

156 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

environmental fundamentals or “Mandatory Rules,” which makes it possible to classify each site according to its level of deployment of these fundamentals and good practices in terms of environmental protection (A, B, C, D, or E and overall % per site). For each of the 50 identified risks, the system provides a detailed presentation of the

actions required

to

reduce criticality and achieve adequate or optimum status. When building action plans, the priority is to address any critical situations with a view to mitigating the most significant risks and preventing serious infringements.

Lastly, a networked organization bringing together in-house environmental protection experts in every country (some 200 people), with Club Métier meetings on a regular basis, internal cross audits (one site audits another and vice versa) and in-person forums every 3 years (except during COVID) makes it possible to ensure the cross-functional integration of best practices.

2.2.4.4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness

The Duty of Vigilance Steering Committee monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the Ethics and Compliance Committee once a year (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).

Several systems are in place to monitor measures taken and ensure they are effective. They are summarized in the table below.

Each site regularly assesses the progress it has made in deploying the “8 Mandatory Rules” on the environment.

The resulting score changes in sync with the progress that the site makes in implementing these environmental fundamentals and best practices. The sites’ scores are verified in the course of internal audits, updated and published several times a year at every level in the company. Suitable implementation of the action plans specifically targeting each of the risks listed in section 2.2.4.3 is also assessed through this process.

To measure the effectiveness of the action plans on environmental performance results, the Group has set up a very precise accounting process for its environmental performance. Each site reports its environmental data (quantities of waste, wastewater and air emissions, consumption of water and energy) in a shared system. These statistics are consolidated at Group level and verified once a year by an independent organization. The results are monitored by the company’s top management at Leadership Team (formerly BoM) meetings.

Lastly, the

sites that

have the

most significant environmental impacts apply a tighter control mechanism based on

their certified

environmental management system. This adds two layers of control, with internal and external audits:

✔ Internal audits in an environmental management

system cover the requirements of ISO 14001 on various topics (soil, water, air, waste, energy, chemicals, legionella, noise and risk prevention) in order to ascertain that the system is effectively dealing with the possible impacts resulting from activities. These internal audits are carried out by teams of two to four Renault auditors from other sites. When it receives the audit report, the audited site maps out its action plan to address each point of non-compliance. The execution and effectiveness of the action plan are verified during the next annual audit.

✔ The last level is an external annual audit carried out by

an independent accredited body with a view to obtaining ISO 14001 certification.

2.2.5.1. Risk mapping: identification, analysis and prioritization

Methodology

Renault Group considers that the risks presented above in sections 2.2.2 to 2.2.4 of the Vigilance Plan are applicable to our suppliers and subcontractors. These risks are

therefore addressed7

as

part of

the responsible

purchasing approach.

- Human rights and fundamentalfreedoms: 10 risks

- Health and safety: 10 risks

-

Environment: 9 risks

To prioritize them, Renault Group relies on an external database, the experience of in-house specialists, and analysis of audit reports over the years. As the nature of the most critical risks hinges heavily on the geographic area, the Group maps risks by country.

2.2.5.2. Procedures for regular assessment ofthe suppliers’ and subcontractors’ situation with which the Group has an established

business relationship, in light of the risk mapping

The assessment of suppliers’ situation in light of the risk mapping is based on two pillars:

-

assessments via

an Internet platform (principally EcoVadis) to assess suppliers’ and subcontractors’ policies and actions relating to environmental, social and corporate governance;

- on-site audits of suppliers and subcontractors. From 2018 to 2022, the Group commissioned 122 social, safety, health, environmental and ethics audits of supplier sites, performed by outside companies in six countries: Algeria, China, India, Romania, Russia and Turkey.

2.2.5.3. Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements

In order to prevent serious infringements, under the duty of vigilance, Renault Group:

● applies its responsible purchasing policy, a set of requirements with respect to

its suppliers and subcontractors (a);

● regards the commitment to comply with its responsible purchasing policy as a decisive criterion when choosing suppliers and subcontractors (b);

● monitors implementation of corrective action plans prepared following supplier site audits (c);

● relies on a dedicated team, reporting to the Purchasing Department (d).

This action plan includes constant progress updates, which will be reported on at a later date.

a. A responsible purchasing policy, the cornerstone of the supplier relationship

The risks identified in the mapping are addressed in a requirement with respect to

our suppliers and subcontractors (see table next page). Renault Group relies on documents that set out principles of responsible contractual relationships with suppliers:

● Renault-Nissan Corporate Social Responsibility Guidelines for Suppliers (2015). Distributed to all Renault Group suppliers and subcontractors, this document summarizes the Group’s ESG expectations of suppliers and subcontractors in matters of safety and quality, human and labor rights, environment, compliance and non-disclosure of information; The Group asks its suppliers and subcontractors to commit in writing to comply with these guidelines. They are also requested to use them with their own suppliers;

● Global Framework Agreement on social, societal and environmental responsibility, signed in 2013, with the

In IndustriALL Global Union and the Group Works Council. this document, undertakes to

Renault Group

communicate the Framework Agreement to

its suppliers and subcontractors. It asks them to commit to implementing the employees’ fundamental rights mentioned in chapter 1 of the Framework Agreement in their own companies and encourages them to do

likewise with their own

suppliers. If necessary, corrective action plans are put in place with the support of Renault Group;

● Renault Group Green Purchasing Guidelines (2018): this document is distributed to all Group suppliers and describes requirements in matters of environmental management, policies on chemicals and recycling;

● Renault Group policy on the supply of cobalt and minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (2019). This policy provides suppliers and

their subcontractors with details

of products that may contain such minerals, and the Group’s expectations as regards human rights and child labor in the supply chain;

● Renault Group commitments regarding sourcing of sustainable natural rubber (2022).

The purchasing function also has a dedicated code of practice that complements the Code of Ethics. This document is available on the Group’s intranet site. It is aimed at all managers and employees in the Purchasing Department and the Alliance Purchasing Organization (APO) and at anyone who is in contact with suppliers and/ or who has an influence on purchasing activities within Renault Group and/or for Renault Group. The code applies

to all Renault Group purchasing processes and, in particular, to compliance with Renault’s strategy, to selecting suppliers, reviewing performance and, more generally speaking, to any contact or communication with suppliers.

2.2.5.4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness

The Duty of Vigilance Steering Committee monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the Ethics and Compliance Committee once a year (see section 2.2.6.2 Governance for details).

As discussed in section 2.2.5.2 of this document, Renault Group uses audits and assessments to track its suppliers’

and subcontractors’ ESG performance. The Group measures its suppliers’ compliance with its ESG criteria through four main topics:

● percentage of direct purchase volume of automotive parts covered by a ESG assessment;

Parts (Top 200)

Percentage of direct purchase volume covered by a CSR assessment.1

Percentage of high or very high CSR performance in 3 years (% oftotal purchases).2

Number of direct supplier groups covered by a CSR assessment.

Number of CSR supplier groups high or very high less than 3 years

(number of supplier groups).

● percentage of total purchase volume of automotive parts covered by a high or very high grade ESG assessment;

● number of parts suppliers subject to a ESG assessment;

● number of parts suppliers whose ESG score reflects high or very high performance.

In 2022, the ESG performance (Group level) of the Top 200 Top 500 suppliers

and the

parts (representing approximately 87% and 97% respectively of total parts purchases) of Renault Group was as follows:

The TOP 200/500 parts are the Top 200/500 suppliers calculated on the basis of 2021 revenue.

(2) Percentage of total purchase volume covered by a high or very high grade CSR assessment (3 years) on the TOP 200/500 parts: The indicator represents the percentages of direct purchase volume on the TOP 200/500 parts for which a valid CSR assessment of the supplier (EcoVadis assessment or equivalent, less than three years) with more than 45 points out of 100 is identified (EcoVadis considers that suppliers with 45 or more points are not at risk). The TOP 200/500 parts are the Top 200/500suppliers calculated on the basis of 2021 turnover.

Below is the average performance in 2022 of the 192/429 suppliers of the Renault Group Top 200/500 parts:

2.2.6 Whistleblowing tool and Governance

2.2.6.1. Whistleblowing tool

The Vigilance Plan includes a whistleblowing tool and system to collect reports relating to risks or events involving serious infringements of human rights, freedoms, health, and the safety fundamental environment.

In accordance with the requirements of the 2016 French “Sapin II” Law on transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernization of economic life, Renault Group very early on set up a whistleblowing tool, WhistleB, which is to

accessible Group employees, external or occasional employees and suppliers with which the Group has an established business relationship. Note that the law of March 21, 2022, on the protection of whistleblowers8 ,

in addition to confirming the parties mentioned above, added shareholders, job applicants and former employees.

WhistleB covers the topics required by the 2017 French law on the duty of vigilance.

This platform is managed by an external service provider and can be accessed at any time, any day of the week, on a professional or personal computer, tablet or smartphone, via the Internet A at

https://Renault.whistleb.com. telephone hotline for direct reporting is also available. The global whistleblowing system is available in 14 languages. It ensures confidentiality of communication and therefore allows the whistleblower to remain anonymous subject to local law. Renault Group prohibits and does not practice any form of retaliation against whistleblowers.

During 2022, new awareness-raising initiatives were carried out, notably on the Group’s intranet, to remind

2.2.6.2. Vigilance plan governance

Renault Group set up specific governance arrangements for the Vigilance Plan in 2021. This new governance better defines the various levels in the company that are involved in preparing, approving

and effectively implementing the Vigilance Plan:

people how the system works internally. In France, for example: communications on the Group’s intranet and at the industrial sites. Renault Group has also reminded all its suppliers and subcontractors of the possibilities available on WhistleB and circulated a detailed user guide. Renault Group has committed to providing this type of reminder every two years.

In 2022, 460 reports were received via the whistleblowing tool worldwide9 . All reports are examined. Most of the cases are dealt with locally, by the country or subsidiary Ethics and Compliance Correspondent. Reports relating to France and Corporate departments are handled by the Whistleblowing Department and

the Whistleblowing Committee (CTA), which is made up of seven members and three experts and is chaired by Renault Group’s SVP, Audit, Risk, Ethics and Compliance. In other countries, alerts are handled by the Country Ethics and Compliance

Committee (CECP), chaired by the Country Director. detailed report containing statistics on whistleblowing worldwide is presented annually to the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECG) and the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR), a specialist committee of Renault Group’s Board of Directors.

In 2022, we worked on upgrading the mechanism to integrate the requirements in the new EU Whistleblowing Directive10 .

The corporate whistleblowing tool presented here is intended to complement other channels to report whistleblowing alerts, namely trade unions, management lines, human resources teams, the Ethics and Compliance Department.

● the action plan is coordinated and monitored by the Sustainable Development Department via a Steering Committee;

● the Strategy Director, who reports directly to the CEO, is the sponsor of the Vigilance Plan.

8 French Law No. 2022-401 of March 21, 2022, aimed at improving the protection of whistleblowers transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of October 23, 2019.

9 These reports go beyond the scope of the French duty of vigilance law. The deployment of this whistleblowing system also allows Renault Group to comply with the French law of 2016, known as “Sapin 2,” on transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernisation of economic life.

There is now a consensus on the magnitude of environmental challenges and the urgency of finding solutions. These challenges profoundly affect all economic activities and notably mobility. Beyond the expectations of the stakeholders regarding the transport sector, the ability of Renault Group to propose innovative solutions also provides new economic opportunities and boosts competitiveness.

The automotive industry needs to address major environmental issues:

● climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions, for which the Paris COP 21 agreement has plotted an ambitious reduction path;

● resources, the limited availability of which implies changing modes of production and use;

● health, a major concern (particularly in cities), which requires reduction of pollutant emissions;

● global biodiversity loss caused by human-induced pressures on ecosystems.

To meet these challenges, Renault Group has had an environmental policy since the late 1990s. It applies throughout the vehicle lifecycle, from design to end of life, and is fully in line with the company’s strategic plan (see figure below).

The “Renaulution” strategic plan, launched in January 2021, thus opened a new era for the Group: it will guarantee its sustainable profitability and respect for its new ambition to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.

At the 2021 General Meeting, the Group announced its new sustainability strategy, one of the three pillars of which is the environment, “Green as a Business” The strategy defines two major environmental priorities: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the circular economy.

The climate strategy, also announced at the 2021 General Meeting, provides for an action plan up to 2030 from upstream to downstream of the value chain, from the supply of materials and components to the end of life of vehicles. As vehicle use is responsible for more than 80% of the Group’s carbon footprint, this phase of the product lifecycle is the priority of the climate plan.

For each area of action, the Group has defined monitoring indicators, specific targets and action plans. These are detailed in chapter 2.3.2 of this document.

The transformation of the Flins plant into the Refactory, Europe’s first circular economy plant dedicated to mobility, is emblematic of the Group’s vision: to rely on a

complete recycling industrial ecosystem that is both a response to the environmental challenge, particularly for the most strategic or critical materials, and an economic asset

and remanufacturing

that generates revenues and profits.

Lastly, the creation of the Mobilize brand, which aims to develop mobility, data and energy services, is another lever for the Group’s transformation, creating environmental and societal value through its electric shared-mobility solutions and battery services.

“The Group’s environmental policy is a pillar of our engagement and responsible capitalism and is core to its transformation and its raison d’être, which combine economic and environmental performance”

(Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman, and Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer, April 2021).

Supervision ofthe environmental strategy (including climate) by the Board of Directors

The of directors oversees

board and implementation of the Group’s environmental strategy and the associated risks and opportunities. Each year, the board examines issues related to climate change, Renault Group’s strategy on greenhouse gas emissions, the electrification of its product range and the impact of new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants.

the definition

In order to strengthen governance on these issues, the board of directors created a specialized committee in 2019 whose duties include conducting an in-depth examination of environmental issues: the Ethics and CSR Committee. In 2021, it was decided to combine this committee with the

Strategy

Committee, as

environmental, social and governance issues are an

integral part of the Group’s strategy. In 2022, this new Strategy and CSR Committee was renamed the Strategy and Sustainability Committee.

This Strategy and Sustainability Committee is made up of 60% independent directors, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. It met five times in 2022, with an attendance rate of 97.1% of its members.

In 2022, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee examined the following topics in particular:

● the Group's strategy in terms of social, societal and environmental responsibility;

● monitoring and implementation of the "Renaulution" Strategic Plan;

● regular monitoring of all the Group's priority strategic projects;

● the strategy and development of the circular economy activity;

● the development of “ReKnow University” to support the development of mobility professions;

● the development of partnerships with Nissan on

concrete operational projects covering markets, vehicles and technologies;

● the impact and mitigation plans of the semiconductor crisis;

● the electric vehicle value chain strategy;

● the Group's decarbonization strategy and the review of its climate report;

● the used vehicle strategy;

● commercial vehicle strategy

● strategic trends in Latin America;

● the Alpine brand strategy;

● the performance of partnerships and the Group's new “horizontal strategy” of cooperation with the various players in its ecosystem;

● the objectives in terms of gender diversity in the governing bodies and

● the review of Chapter 2 “Sustainable Development” of the 2021 Universal Registration Document, including the non-financial performance statement (EFPD).

For more details on the activity report of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, see Chapter 3.1.6.3 of the Company's 2022 Universal Registration Document.

Management of climate objectives by the Board of Management and the Strategy and Business Development Department

The Leadership Team (formerly BoM) and the Strategy and Business Development Department steer the Group’s

environmental the objectives. The focuses of environmental policy are discussed once a year and arbitrated within the BoM on the proposal of the Director of Strategy and Business Development. For this purpose, the BoM relies on the Group Sustainable Development

166

Committee. The areas of authority of the members of this Committee, particularly in sustainable development, are detailed in section 3.1.3.

The Strategy and Business Development Department is responsible for preparing, deploying and monitoring the implementation of the environmental policy in all sectors of the company throughout its value chain and for each stage in the lifecycle of its vehicles. To do this, it relies on a network of correspondents deployed in all the company's functions, as well as on the areas of expertise. These were created in 2010 within the Group in areas such as “energy, environment and raw materials strategy,” “vehicle CO2” and “air quality and substances.” The experts who make up these teams provide in-depth knowledge of strategic issues and an approach recognized internally for its rigor, neutrality and cross-disciplinary nature.

The roll-out of the environmental component of the strategic plan by the Strategy and Business Development Department thus covers all of Renault Group’s activities and supports its development of new products and services.

Compensation criteria linked to the achievement of environmental commitments

In light of the importance of climate issues for the Group, the compensation of the executive corporate officer includes, since 2013, a criterion related to respect for the environment and aimed at “leadership in environmental performance: CO2 emissions of vehicles in Europe, Renault

More the Group carbon footprint.”

recently, on recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the board of directors proposed a change to the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer by adding criteria relating to:

● meeting the European regulatory target for passenger car CO2 emissions (CAFE standards1 );

● reducing the carbon footprint of Renault Group passenger cars and utility vehicles registered worldwide. In 2022 and 2023, the compensation policy regarding the Chief Executive Officer has changed to include new environmental criteria:

●

a criterion relating to the number of used vehicles reconditioned at

Flins (in the annual variable compensation);

● a criterion relating to the development of the circular economy activity (in the annual variable compensation);

● a criterion related to the Group’s electrified passenger vehicle sales mix in Europe over cumulative periods of three years (in the performance action plan);

● a criterion related to the reduction of kg of CO2 emitted per vehicle produced in Europe over cumulative periods of 3 years (in the co-investment plan).

(For further details on the remuneration elements of the Chief Executive Officer, see chapters 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.4.2 of this Registration Document).

2.3.1.3.1. Resources EFPD7b

Renault Group invests about €2.3bn in Research and Development every year11 .

Most of these resources are allocated to the development of new low-emission vehicles, powertrains and batteries. Upstream of new vehicle projects, between €90m and €150m are allocated each year to research and advanced engineering12. A significant share of this spending is earmarked for innovations specifically aimed at reducing

vehicle emissions (by extending the electric vehicle range), which is a regulatory imperative, particularly in Europe. Another share is allocated to developing services provided by batteries (second-life use and smart charging).

2.3.1.3.2. Life Cycle Assessments

Renault is committed to measuring the environmental impacts of its vehicles throughout their life cycle from one generation to the next. Since 2004, Renault Group has been measuring the environmental impact of its vehicles throughout their life cycle, from the extraction of the raw materials needed to manufacture them to their end of life. Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) are therefore performed:

● prior to the vehicle design process, to analyze the environmental

potential

impact and benefits

technological innovations; of

● after the design process, to confirm and measure the reduction of environmental

impacts

from

one

generation of vehicles to another.

At end-2022, 25 models representing 78% of the Group’s global passenger car sales under the Renault, Dacia, Alpine and RSM (Renault Samsung Motors) brands were thus subjected to a complete LCA. Starting with the launch of Twingo III in September 2014, all new models are subjected to a comparative LCA with respect to their predecessor. Each of these LCAs is subjected to a critical review by an independent expert following the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, to evaluate, firstly, the methodology used and, secondly, all of the

11 See section 5.1, 2022 Earnings Report

calculations and interpretations performed. The LCA reports for new models and their critical review are available on request.

For further methodological details, please refer to section 2.6.1.2.

The graph below presents the results of the comparative life cycle analysis of the 1st generation ICE Captur, the 2 nd generation ICE Captur and the Captur Plug-in Hybrid “E-Tech,” in the form of a norming comparison. Norming consists of measuring the relative weight of the impacts of vehicles studied the in relation to the global environmental impacts in a reference year, relative to a person.

The LCA results illustrate the relevance of the Plug-in hybrid vehicle in terms of the fight against global warming

Over the entire life cycle, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is 32% for Captur E-Tech compared with 2nd gen. Captur, taking into account an average European electricity mix for battery charging. With the electricity mix in France, the reduction was 53 %. The influence of the electricity mix used for charging on the final result is also notable for the acidification potential indicator, with a reduction of 34% for Captur E-Tech charged with the French electricity mix, compared with Captur E-Tech charged with the average European mix.

Potential depletion of mineral resources

The indicator of potential depletion of mineral resources shows a negative impact related to the manufacture of the electrified vehicle traction battery. To meet this challenge, the Group is investing in the circular economy: participating in the development of new solutions for recycling active battery materials, thus helping to reduce the need for virgin materials (see quantified, dated targets in section 2.3.2.2).

management practices and the handling of chemical products in day-to-day activities. In addition, educational and awareness-raising activities on environmental protection regularly take place through internal communication

channels or through weekly team meetings.

Plant employees receive workstation training, including environmental aspects, particularly chemical risks arising from handling, storage and spills, and the sorting of waste.

In the majority of plants, this training is done through a specific Dojo (workshop) and involves a hands-on approach to waste

Employees in positions requiring specific environmental expertise have access to training associated with their activity, provided in the form of internal training modules (e.g. training for ISO 14001 auditors or design-for-recycling) or through a specialized external organization if a specific area of expertise is required. Renault employees in France also have access to eco-driving training.

Fresque du Climat

Launched in 2021, the deployment of the “Fresque du Climat” among employees of Renault Group’s Ile-de-France sites continued in 2022 with 571 people trained. These educational workshops based on collective intelligence aim to raise awareness of climate change. This training is a permanent Group training opportunity and has been included in the 2023 plan.

2.3.1.3.5. Environmental management system in the plants

In 2022, the industrial environment network will be made up approximately 280 members spread over 12 countries and 42 sites. Environmental management in Renault Group plants is underpinned by four pillars:

1. Continuous improvement based on ISO 14001

Starting in 1995, Renault began systematically implementing an environmental management approach at its sites, along with a drive for continuous improvement,

on 14001. This was to reduce based ISO done

environmental impact and ensure regulatory compliance. Since 2008, 100% of Renault Group’s industrial sites13 and the nine main engineering and logistics facilities have been ISO 14001-certified.

13 The Meyzieu site (new site in the scope) is in the process of being certified. The internal audit was carried out in 2022 and the external audit is scheduled for the first half of 2023.

2. Group-wide tools and standards

In order to control these main environmental risks, as required by the French vigilance law, Renault Group has developed a tool called “Mandatory Rules Environment.” This assessment tool, deployed starting in 2021, can be used to identify and prioritize environmental risks (see 2.2.4.1. “Environment” paragraph). Industrial standards covering all areas related to the environment define the minimum requirements that apply the

to Group’s sites (see “Eco-design of industrial processes” paragraph below). These ensure that practices are standardized and reflect and adhere to the Company’s policies and objectives in terms of the environment, no matter in which country the plants are located, in particular when the plants are not subject to a binding regulatory framework. The “Mandatory Rules Environment” tool highlights the key points of these standards.

This is particularly important in countries without a framework.

stringent regulatory For environmental management and the handling of chemicals, the sites can also rely on the availability of standardized tools managed by expertfunctions. These tools include:

● an expert system called Écorisques, available worldwide in the main languages used within the Group. The system determines and ranks the environmental impact from activities and potential hazards in relation to the plants’ chemical risk

and prioritizes them in the plants’ environmental action plan;

●

a reporting system for environmental impacts and energy consumption (R2E);

● a CHEMIS (Chemical Information System) database, available in the main languages used within the Group, for the management of hazardous substances and the prevention of chemical risks. CHEMIS is the key tool in Renault Group chemical risk management process, which aims, from both environmental and health standpoints, to introduce chemicals safely, to prevent the risks associated with their use, and to anticipate technological and regulatory changes (see 2.3.2.3.2);

● a process to monitor and track compliance with national and EU environmental legislation;

● a documentary database of Environmental standards and best practices, accessible from any Group site.

3. Eco-design of industrial processes

Renault’s industrial projects are designed according to a development strategy punctuated by milestones. At these milestones, each business line checks that the project

170 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

complies with the defined rules and verifies convergence with the other business lines. The HSEE Department is part of this Group approach.

With regard to the environment, the project must be designed in such a way that the site hosting it is able to comply with the mandatory rules described in the Environmental Mandatory Rules. These rules define the minimum requirements applicable to all the Group’s sites, bearing in mind that if local regulatory requirements are more demanding, these take precedence. To achieve this objective, the Group also relies on the new methodological tool currently being deployed, the “HSEE in projects” Mandatory Rules described in paragraph 2.2.3.

For example, acoustic emission modeling was carried out for equipment to be installed in 2023 at the Flins site. These models made it possible to take into account the configuration of the planned site (with walls capable of reflecting sounds) and to challenge the supplier to ensure that noise levels towards the neighborhood would be compliant from the first day of operation of the future equipment.

To complement this applicable

shared

base of Group

minimum requirements to all projects, technological innovations may be introduced according to constraints or opportunities related to the local environment. This is the case, for example, of the “Nickel- Free” technological innovation described in paragraph 2.3.2.4.2.

4. Environmental management system audits

Since the end of the 1990s, the Group has used internal environmental audits at all of its industrial facilities as well as its main engineering and logistics facilities in order to monitor the implementation of ISO 14001 requirements, and especially the compliance with its own internal standards for the protection of the environment. These complement the external audits performed annually by a certified independent body.

Internal audits are therefore conducted by members of the industrial environmental network (environmental managers and business specialists), using joint audits that encourage exchanges of best practice between plants and stimulate improvements in environmental performance.

As of end-2022, the network had 53 internal environmental auditors who were specifically trained and qualified in accordance with ISO 14001 and knowledge of the various environmental topics. Each new auditor embarks on a progressive skills development path until eventually becoming an audit manager.

In 2019, Renault Group was the first carmaker to have decarbonization targets validated with the Science Based-Targets (SBTi) initiative.

In April 2021, Renault Group published its Climate Plan. It is broken down into nine major actions over the entire lifecycle of vehicles described below. They will be gradually rolled out across the Group until 2030, an interim milestone toward our ambition of carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050. In addition to the nine actions, the Group has tools and processes to manage risks and opportunities.

2.3.2.1.2.1. Actions on the vehicle usage phase – Scope 3 Downstream

In 2022, the vehicle usage phase accounts for more than 80% of Renault Group’s carbon footprint14 .

Action #1: Electrify 100% of new Renault passenger car models by 2025

COz

An internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle in Europe emits 3 times more CO2e in its lifecycle than an electric vehicle15 .

EU Member States must implement national energy and climate plans (NECP) guaranteeing their contribution to achieving the EU’s climate and energy goals. As part of this

14 Use and fuels and electricity required for use. See carbon footprint in 2.3.2.1.3. 15 Source: Transport & Environment (T&E) 2020.

effort, they are phasing out the sale of ICE vehicles (by 2030 for the United Kingdom and by 2040 at the latest for France). Furthermore, the UN predicts that two thirds of the world’s population will be urban by 2050, and cities are already increasingly restricting access for ICE cars.

In order to achieve its target of electrifying 100% of new models of Renault passenger cars by 2025 in Europe, the company is:

● Pooling production across three platforms: CMF-B and CMF-EV (for electric vehicles), CMF-CD;

● Establishing “Renault ElectriCity” in northern France, which will be the largest, most competitive electric vehicle production center in Europe;

● Launching 7 electric models under the Renault brand, including 2 C-segment models. Two electric models were launched in 2022: Megane and Kangoo EV;

● Accelerating electrification by shortening the time to develop a new vehicle by 25%.

The Renault brand’s ambition is to have electric vehicles represent nearly 90% of its passenger vehicle sales in Europe by 2030.

To support this acceleration, Mobilize Power Solutions, a

Renault Group subsidiary specializing in customized recharging solutions for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, is simplifying the transition to electric mobility for professionals and private individuals. Today, Mobilize Power Solutions is present in 11 key European electric mobility markets: Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium,

Mobilize, the brand dedicated to new mobility and services around vehicles, is also developing many other services to facilitate the adoption of electric mobility:

● Mobilize Smart Charge: optimize charging costs and reduce carbon footprints

Announcement of the creation of Ampere

● Mobilize Charge Pass: a single card for recharging at more than 260,000 charging points in Europe

● Mobilize Visa Card: finance the installation of a home recharging solution, facilitate recharging on the move and accumulate credit that can be put towards any purchase.

With Ampere, Renault Group is creating an autonomous entity that will be the first electric and software pure player from a vehicle manufacturer. Ampere will develop, manufacture, and sell fully electric passenger cars with advanced SDV (Software Defined Vehicle) technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will bring the best of both worlds: the know-how and assets of the Group with the focus and agility of a pure player in electric vehicles (see section 1.1.2).

Action #2: Become a European leader in hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles by 2025

O

With models such as Kangoo, Trafic and Master, Renault is a European leader in light commercial vehicles (LCVs).

The very strong growth of this market and the tightening of diesel standards have led the Group to develop electric versions for these models.

Today, the aim is to improve performance in terms of range and charging speed for heavy-duty use.

To extend the range of the electric vehicle without increasing the size of the battery, or even by reducing it, hydrogen fuel cell technology (Dual Power) provides additional zero-emission energy. In addition to charging at electric stations, vehicles can be charged with hydrogen in just a few minutes.

In June 2021, Renault and Plug Power launched a joint venture called Hyvia to offer a global hydrogen solution providing:

● commercial vehicles with a range of 400 kilometers (WLTP standard) and reduced charging time (less than 5 minutes);

● complete turnkey solutions for fuel cell commercial vehicles: charging stations, supply of green hydrogen from decarbonized energy.

HYVIA has set a target of achieving a 30% share of the European hydrogen LCV market by 2030. Its first vehicles have been approved, and major customers have wanted test

to the Hydrogen technology with HYVIA’s first production vehicles: Chronopost, Engie, Orange, Equans, Alpine F1 Team (in France), Airbus, Port of Hamburg, Packeta, and Maximator Hydrogen GmbH (in Germany).

Through Hyvia, Renault Group plans to continue building strong partnerships in the field of hydrogen. With FOVIA since the end of 2021, the Group has been developing hydrogen tanks for light commercial vehicles. In addition, on the basis of collaborative projects, Renault Group will develop solutions integrating all public and private players in the production and distribution of energy.

In addition to mobility, Hyvia will offer fuel cell and charging solutions, manufactured in Flins, France, to other industries.

Renault Group developing is low-emission engines (E-Tech hybrid and gas) to complement its offer of electric vehicles.

Developed exclusively, the E-Tech hybrid technology reduces the fuel consumption of a hybrid engine by 40% compared with an equivalent internal combustion engine in urban cycle. Its E-Tech plug-in hybrid version delivers a zero-emission mobility solution.

Acceleration of the E-Tech hybrid offering:

● launch of a new hybrid model by the Renault brand in 2022 (Austral) in addition to the three in 2021 (Captur, Arkana, and Megane Saloon);

● target: 35% Renault hybrid vehicle sales in 2025;

● deploying new technologies to further reduce hybrid vehicle emissions: connectivity, eco-driving and a 100% electric mode to enable access to low-emission zones.

Consumption by vehicles is approved according to standardized cycles that are representative of usage but do not cover all driving styles (more or less aggressive) or all real driving conditions (use of heating or air conditioning, urban or rural areas, traffic flow, etc.). For an electric vehicle, the same reasoning can be applied to electricity consumption and range. (See appendix 2.6.1.7 Emission standards applicable to passenger cars in the European Union).

Under favorable driving and temperature conditions, a driver with an economical driving style (an “eco” driver) can achieve the same fuel consumption as a WLTP cycle, which is up to 25% less than an “average” driver. A “dynamic” customer can consume up to 40% more than the “average” driver and 70% more than an “eco” driver16 .

1/ Delegative systems or active assistance.

These systems perform all or part of the driving tasks.

02

The first two generations of systems, becoming more widespread today, limit consumption by selecting “Eco Mode”, which acts on:

● reduction of acceleration capabilities under certain conditions;

● maximum speed limitation for electric vehicles;

● efficient management of thermal comfort.

The third-generation technologies, launched on Megane E-Tech and Austral in 2021, can also take full charge of certain tasks for more energy-efficient driving: eco and predictive cruise control, adjustment to terrain, speed limitations, traffic density, etc.

2/ Participatory systems.

They make drivers active in their “eco-driving” by providing information to help them to consume less fuel or electricity. Renault Group offers several types:

● “Eco Coach”: the system displays real-time information on the vehicle’s operation on the dashboard (rev counter for internal combustion vehicles, power meter

for electric vehicles, instantaneous and average consumption) and eco-driving aids (gear change, lift foot off accelerator to anticipate, optimal speed to reach a green light, etc.);

● “Eco Score”: the system evaluates the driving style; drivers become aware of their level of eco-driving and their potential for improvement.

3/ Gamification and rewards

Motivation is essential for sustainable behavioral change, so gamification tools based on challenge and reward are effective levers to encourage users of Renault Group vehicles to adopt eco-driving:

● “Eco Challenge” (“Reward”): the system analyses past journeys to generate advice on how to optimize future journeys; the driver can self-assess and compare with others. This function belongs to generation 4 and will be available on smartphones and computers for both private customers and fleet asset managers.

A personal car is actually in use only 10% of the time and loses half of its value in just three years. With this knowledge, some users are seeking to reduce the overall cost oftheirtravel and turning to new mobility solutions.

One of these is shared mobility, which optimizes the use of a car and reduces the number of vehicles in circulation, as well as their environmental impact.

With regard to road transport, 25% of greenhouse gases are emitted during the “last mile”, i.e. during delivery to the end customer.

Mobilize was created in particular to meet these challenges: to move from the model based on ownership to a model based on use with 100% electric vehicles, designed for a specific use. The brand offers a wide range of vehicle-related services (VaaS, Vehicle as a Service)

Renault Group intends to accelerate the deployment of more efficient, low-carbon, reusable batteries by acting on their entire lifecycle:

02

● Low-carbon battery production: in association with suppliers, reduce the carbon footprint of battery production by using decarbonized energy and materials. Renault Group aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the new R5’s battery by 20% by 2025 compared with the Zoe’s battery in 2019. The reduction is expected to reach 35% in 2030. In this respect, Renault Group has signed three agreements with material suppliers since 2021: with Terrafame for sustainable nickel sourcing (low carbon and traceability of the entire supply chain), with Vulcan for less carbon-intensive lithium in 2021 and with Managem for low-carbon cobalt sulfate produced in Morocco in 2022. This is in addition to the agreements with Verkor and Envision-Aesc to produce the batteries in France by 2025.

● Maintenance: deployment of battery repair centers during their first life (around a hundred operate as of the end of 2022, including a center of expertise and repair within the Flins Refactory). Launch of an offering of second-hand batteries for the repair of electric vehicles.

● Second life: repurposing batteries for the stationary storage of renewable energy, mobile solutions (boats, cooling systems, airport machinery). In 2022, production will start at Flins of stationary systems produced as part of Renault Group’s partnership with “Betteries,” a start- up specializing in the recovery and use of batteries from electric vehicles. Betteries uses recycled EV batteries to develop transportable electric generators suitable for a variety of purposes (e.g. on construction sites or in food trucks). These systems are assembled at the Flins Refactory. These second-life uses of our batteries make it possible to avoid GHG emissions.

● Recycling: closed-loop recycling of strategic materials (cobalt, nickel, lithium) to produce new batteries. For these three materials, Renault Group plans to reach 80% of recycled material reintegrated into the production of new batteries by 2030 (closed loop).

Recycling, maintenance, repair and second-life activities are carried out at the Refactory in Flins, France (see box in section 2.3.2.2).

In addition to these activities, starting from the launch of the R5 model in 2024, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology will enable electric vehicles to feed energy into the power grid to regulate peak consumption.

Renault Group has set a target of reducing CO2e/kg emissions in the parts and materials supply chain by 30% by 2030 compared with 2019. To achieve this, Renault Group is working with its suppliers on six priority areas for improvement:

● Area 1: Set up a carbon footprint assessment system using outside surveys conducted by an accredited CDP supply chain organization.

● Area 2: Require suppliers to make CSR commitments and have their performance assessed by an outside organization (see 2.2.5).

● Area 3: Identify the six highest-emitting commodities (materials and parts) and implement a joint action plan with suppliers to design a lower-GHG process.

● Area 4: Co-develop a co-innovation policy to invent new technologies to meet future regulations and consumer expectations.

● Area 5: Increase local sourcing for production plants. Partnerships with Verkor and Envision to produce batteries in France, as close as possible to the ElectriCity industrial hub, from 2025.

● Area 6: Establish internal carbon pricing for the selection

of materials and other procurement decisions (see 2.3.2.1.2.3).

In addition, in 2020, Renault Group became a signatory of the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) to foster a virtuous cycle for the supply ofraw materials.

In the fight against climate change, the circular economy is an essential lever because greenhouse gas emissions can be avoided. The circular economy strategy and indicators are set out in chapter 2.3.2.2 of this document (“Resources and circular economies”).

This

work includes increasing the use of recycled materials in the manufacture of vehicles. Objective: All new vehicles worldwide to be made with 33% recycled materials by 2030.

In addition to the issues related to the constant increase in the price of fossil fuels, the use of low-carbon energy and the reduction of consumption are at the same time major levers for the climate trajectory, levers for competitiveness (energy savings) and levers for energy independence in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment.

That is why it is being managed by a dedicated corporate team, via a network of energy managers deployed across all Group sites, according to an organization based on the principles of ISO 50001 outlined in the diagram below. The Group has also embarked on a global roadmap for the certification of its industrial sites, with the first stage covering all French sites in 2023. At end-2022, the certified sites are Bursa, Cléon, Le Mans and Sandouville.

Since 2021, the energy-saving and controlled performance approach has covered tertiary, logistics and distribution sites in addition to industrial sites. For example, the installation of solar panels on the roof of a dealership in Switzerland17 will avoid the emission of almost 50,000 metric tons of CO2e per year.

Four drivers:

1. Industrial footprint:

More compact sites will lead to a reduction of space to be lit and heated. The sites are continuing their overall compaction trajectory with a target of reducing 750,000 m² of covered buildings by 2025. Of particular note in 2022

Renault Group is accelerating the decarbonization plan for its factories in France and Spain and innovating with new partners

● Spain. In April 2021, Renault Group signed a contract with the energy supplier Iberdrola to cover 100% of its energy consumption in Spain with renewable energy.

● France. In November 2022, the Group announced three major partnerships with energy players:

● With Voltalia, the largest renewable electricity supply contract in France. This contract will enable Renault Group to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of its production activities in France in 2027 through the installation of photovoltaic panels.

● With the ENGIE Group, a first-of-its-kind deep geothermal project in Europe that would replace 70% of the gas needs of the Douai factory by 2025;

In 2015, Renault Group was one of the first companies to join the FRET21 initiative. It unites the community of shippers in efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of freight. In 2019, the Group was awarded the EVE Trophy by ADEME for the biggest improvement in reducing CO2e emissions from transport and decided to commit to FRET21 a second time (between 2019 and 2021 on a 2018 baseline). The result of this second commitment was once again positive, with a result of -6.69% CO2e emissions for a target of-5.5%.

Today, the objective of the supply chain is to work to further reduce the carbon footprint of transportation, logistics platforms and its packaging.

2021-2030 action plan built on 4 pillars across the logistics chain:

● Deployment of biogas and biofuel trucks starting in 2021, and continued in 2022, followed by the deployment of electric and hydrogen-powered trucks from 2025. 584 metric tons of CO2e have already been avoided in inbound logistics thanks to the implementation of 4,650 GAS trucks (bio-CNG and CNG) with three carriers in France. On the vehicle distribution side, 11,350 new vehicles were transported with 1,870 B30 trucks from the carrier Dolotrans, for a reduction of 1,026 metric tons of CO2e on a France-Romania flow.

● Scaling up multimodal transportation, in part by increasing the share of rail freight. The implementation of trains for the distribution of vehicles has enabled 3,250 metric tons of CO2e to be saved on flows from the Shiyan factory (China) to the port of Shanghai for 18,800 vehicles transported as well as on a Spain/Austria flow with 920 vehicles.

● Reduction in the number of kilometers traveled per cubic meter of goods thanks to more optimized and

trucks

● Rational management of packaging: reducing its weight, returning used packaging, minimizing waste, increasing the share of recycled material in packaging and eventual elimination of single-use plastics.

Together, these actions have allowed more than 416,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions to be avoided (cumulative over the 2017-2022 period).

Beyond the 2021–2030 action plan, Renault Group expects to further avoid emissions through the development of packaging recycling channels, both within the Group and with its suppliers.

In addition, Renault Group entered into a partnership in 2018 with NEOLINE, a French start-up developing wind- powered cargo ships. Pilot ships are planned for 2024.

2.3.2.1.2.3. Tools and processes in place to manage risks and opportunities

Monitor the reduction of CO2e emissions from vehicles: CAFE Control Tower

In 2018, Renault Group created a specific program team called the “CAFE Control Tower” to monitor the results in Europe and oversee the roadmap each year.

Starting in 2019, the Group also developed a tool to forecast CO2e levels for its registered vehicles in Europe. The CAFE Control Tower reports its results to the Board of Management (BoM) every month.

Outside Europe, the Group is subject to regulatory standards similar to those in Europe. In total, around 70% of the Group’s sales worldwide are thus subject to CAFE- type regulations.

● For industrial facilities, the ICP takes into account changes in the energy market and in CO2e emission allowances. More than half

of the Group's direct emissions, i.e. 11 industrial sites, are subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). The associated financial issues are managed through a specific steering committee. In the context of the European Commission's gradual phasing out of the free allocation of

EU

ETS allowances,

the strategy

implemented by Renault Group aims to minimize the financial burden of the allowances in the medium and long term through efforts to reduce energy consumption at the sites (see above) and rigorous forward-looking management. South Korea has also implemented an emissions trading system since 2015, to which the Busan manufacturing site has been subject since then. Thanks to the emission-reduction measures undertaken before the entry into force of these regulations, the Group did not need to acquire additional allowances. Starting in 2021, the Giheung site is also subject to it and has also not resorted to purchasing allowances.

These various ICPs are revised at least once a year and vary between €100/t CO2e and €200 t/CO2e to take account of market

developments

and

regional

specificities.

These results should be consolidated and formalized by the European Commission in the coming months.

In 2022, Renault Group reached its primary commitment to reduce its global carbon footprint: -25% versus 2010.

The Group’s ambition for 2050 is to achieve carbon neutrality over the entire product lifecycle everywhere in the world (by 2040 in Europe). To align with this goal, new interim milestones to be reached by 2025 and 2030 were set in early 2021 based on results achieved in 2019 (instead of 2010).

First, in 2021, the Flins used vehicle plant started production, and the Shyan plant in China started exporting vehicles to Europe. Then, in 2022, a new manufacturing site started production in Karsan, Turkey. In addition, the electronic components crisis led to a very significant increase in the need for breakdown services and therefore deliveries by air. On a like-for-like basis in 2019 and excluding the effects of the component crisis, there is a reduction in emissions per vehicle of around 10%. Renault Group remains on track to achieve the 30% reduction target in 2030. Thanks to new technologies that will become available in the next few years (such as 40 T EV or hydrogen trucks, a more massive deployment of sail-powered freighters, greater availability of rail solutions), the decarbonization of logistics activities should accelerate significantly starting in 2025.

Long term

Description and impact on the Group's performance

(2040–2050)

CO2 emissions regulations for vehicles are frequently updated to apply increasingly stringent standards. In Europe, the CAFE emissions target of 95 g CO2/km in 2020 was adjusted in 2021 to apply the WLTP standard. In the event of non-compliance, a penalty payment of €95 per excess gram per vehicle sold is due. Based on current sales volumes, each excess gram of CO2/km would incur a penalty of approximately €120 million. Regulatory changes may also introduce traffic bans or restrictions for certain vehicles. These changes may impact R&D costs and/or production costs, arising from the need to adapt our vehicles to the new standards.

The Group is building its offering around lesser-polluting vehicles, in particular by expanding electric vehicle ranges and designing hybrid solutions for internal combustion engines. The introduction of these technologies, which offer different performances in terms of cost, customer service and CO2e emissions, may not match the market’s expectations and pace of growth. CO2e emissions reduction targets will also entail the adjustment of industrial processes and the roll-out of low- carbon production short and medium terms.

technologies in the

The necessary modernization of plants to increase their energy efficiency may push up production and R&D costs.

8 Combined with regulatory changes, the transition to a low-carbon economy may bring about behavioral changes among consumers, such as a shift toward smaller or

more energy-efficient vehicles or toward shared mobility, more quickly than anticipated. A mismatch between the product/service offering and consumer expectations would expose the Group to a decline in revenues.

Environmental issues (carbon footprint reduction and impact on air quality) are a concern for all stakeholders (employees, NGOs, users, etc.). A mismatch between the Group’s product/service offering and environmental requirements could harm its brand image and negatively influence customer purchasing decisions, leading to a decline in revenues. It could also make the Group less attractive to suppliers. A strong environmental reputation also contributes to attracting talent and increasing employee pride in belonging to the Group. A mismatch could affect employee engagement.

The accelerated pace of technological change will create a need to update know- how by investing in training and acquiring new skills.

X Some extreme weather events may disrupt or, in more serious cases, temporarily interrupt the activity of a number of the Group’s production and logistics facilities. An increased frequency or intensity of floods, hurricanes or droughts, combined with higher temperatures and sea levels, can push up risk prevention and maintenance costs, as well as insurance premiums.

The increasing scarcity of some natural resources, such as water, may directly impact the automotive industry. It may oblige the Group to make investments to reduce its consumption or pay financial compensation to residents living near production facilities or to local communities. Furthermore, the use of certain raw materials such as cobalt may generate upward price pressure as sales of electrified vehicles steadily grow. Climate change may lead to structural and geopolitical changes in certain regions. Because the Group has many sites around the world, this could directly impact its activity. Instability in one region or country could require the Group to adjust its industrial strategy. Regional and geopolitical instability can also create weaknesses in the supply chain ecosystem and oblige the Group to reorganize its value chain, pushing up purchase costs.

Description and impact on the Group's performance

(2040–2050)

Combined with evolving CO2 emissions regulations, new consumer preferences for lower-carbon-emission products are a major opportunity to develop new products and enter new markets. As a frontrunner in electric mobility and a leading developer of hybrid technologies and complementary solutions such as fuel cells, Renault Group is well poised to take advantage of these trends. The Group adapts the skills of the workforce by putting in place training sessions about new technology and bolsters its electric vehicle manufacturing capacity with the creation of an “Electro pôle” in France.

8

Building up the circular economy is not only a core driver of carbon neutrality for the Group, but it also underpins the Group’s development of new products and services, especially through its new Mobilize business unit. By contributing to the circular economy, the Group will meet the needs of consumers who want to switch to more sustainable forms of mobility and, at the same time, extend the lifecycle of its products.

To meet carbon footprint reduction targets, the Group must adjust its industrial processes and roll out low-carbon technologies in the short and medium terms. In addition to improving the environmental performance of its production facilities, the Group can use this opportunity to reduce its energy bill and its exposure to future increases in fossil fuel prices.

Renault Group’s efforts to integrate climate change issues into its strategy are an opportunity to strengthen its reputation as a pacesetter in this area. The Group is the first carmaker to have its greenhouse gas reduction targets validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. It is one of the top two out of the 30 automotive sector companies in the ranking by the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) and CDP published in December 202124. This ranking assesses “how companies integrate climate issues into their strategy, their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the quality of their management of these emissions”. Renault Group is also one of the five companies among those ranked whose GHG reduction targets meet the Paris Agreement alignment criteria established by the International Energy Agency. Although it has already established a positive reputation in this area, the Group’s continued efforts to uphold and deepen its commitments can help strengthen the confidence of its stakeholders.

24 This ranking should be updated in 2023.

2.3.2.1.4.3. Climate scenarios

Following the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement (COP 21) in 2015, the Group’s product plan and strategy were redesigned to ensure its contribution to limiting global warming to well below 2°C. This central scenario underpins the "Renaulution" strategic plan.

An analysis of alternative climate scenarios was also conducted to inform

02

the Group’s risk management strategy up to 2050, with intermediate milestones in 2030 and 2040:

New Green Deal

Eco-Techno driven

Retreat and fragmentation

1.5 °C

3 °C

4 °C

Scenario description

In this scenario, the raised awareness of climate risk by all stakeholders around the world (governments, financial institutions and citizen consumers) drives more sustainable regulations, business models and lifestyles. This scenario is enabled by worldwide public-private collaborations. The main emitting industries participate fully in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Through efficient coordination with legislators and robust planning at a global level, new technologies to respond to climate change are developed. This systemic approach to mobility paves the way for the growth of efficient, multimodal services.

In this scenario, the most developed regions maintain worldwide growth. These regions succeed in combining low local levels of emissions with climate-focused economic expansion, through the development of new technologies (including mobility services). Despite this, the lack of worldwide commitment and of coordinated climate policy leads to global warming of about 3 °C, whose physical impacts affect all populations. Carmakers are faced with a wide diversity of usages and demand from one region to another.

Global governance and technologies are lacking, leading to a general economic decline and a retreat from globalization in the aftermath of climate, economic and political crises. Physical risks such as floods, fires and droughts become frequent and uncontrollable, leading to population migration and wider inequalities. Low-tech and low-cost become the norm, including in mobility, and long-distance travel is discouraged.

Since 2017, climate scenario analysis has been an integral part of the Group’s strategic thinking. These analyses are based on external benchmark data, in particular:

● World Automotive Powertrain Outlook, used by the French automotive industry platform (PFA);

● 1.5TECH and

1.5LIFE scenarios presented

by

the European Commission on November 28, 2018;

●

Energy Technology Perspectives, published by the International Energy Agency (B2DS or “Beyond 2°C” scenario).

In 2020 and 2021,

in alignment with

the TCFD’s recommendations, the Group expanded and deepened its analysis of climate scenarios and the implications of climate risks on

its short-, medium- and long-term performance. The three climate scenarios described above were based on this work and on internal scenarios constructed by the R&D Department and the Strategy Department. In 2022, the Group continued its work, including the launch of a comprehensive study of the vulnerability of our industrial and logistics sites to extreme climate scenarios.

2.3.2.1.4.4. Resilience under the different climate scenarios

After identifying climate risks and alternative scenarios, the Group performed an initial analysis to assess the nature and significance of the impacts of each risk on the Group’s short-, medium- and long-term performance, in order to prioritize the issues. The impacts of each risk on performance were assessed according to several criteria, each of which was broken down into sub-criteria for a

Renault Group’s strategy for dealing with the risks and opportunities associated with climate change is detailed in section 2.3.2.1.2.

2.3.2.1.4.5. How the Group identifies climate risks

To meet the TCFD’s recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures, a working group was created in 2020. Its members represent the Group

various departments with strategic added value for the climate project: they include the Head of Risk Management, the

Head of Financial the Strategic Communications, Environmental Planning Department and several technical experts. The “Climate” working Group identified the risks related to climate change (including transition and physical risks), built scenarios, assessed the impacts

2.3.2.1.4.6. How the Group manages climate risks

Identifying and managing risks relating to the environment and to climate change are a part of the Group’s global risk management system, which is supervised by the Risk Management Department. The Group’s risk management system is detailed in section 4.1.

188

of each risk on Group performance under each scenario and developed action plans.

Starting in 2015, work on a materiality matrix had made it possible to identify “material” issues, i.e. those that will have a major impact on the Group’s ecosystem and its performance, on which it will therefore have to focus its efforts. This matrix was updated in 2020 (see section 2.1.4). “Reducing the total carbon footprint” is a top priority for Renault Group. Internal and external stakeholders expect the Group to continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The risk management method applied by Renault Group is based on identifying and assessing risks of any kind, which are then mapped (as mentioned earlier), and on carrying out action plans to deal with these risks, and specifically their net impact and/or probability of occurrence, means of

by

elimination, prevention, protection or transfer.

In 2021, the risks related to global warming were introduced as such in the mapping of the Group’s major risks in order to strengthen their visibility and the management of the associated action plans (see chapter 4.2 of this document). As such, with regard to physical risks, the actions undertaken in the monitoring of existing risks (e.g. risk of natural disasters or risk to raw materials) were supplemented by cross-cutting initiatives such as

the launch of a study of the vulnerability of the industrial and logistics sites in connection with the climate scenarios mentioned above.

02

Risk management policy is applied at Group level for major risks, but it is also rolled out at operating entity level (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries), for vehicle programs and corporate functions.

THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL

In October 2022, Renault Group announced the creation of THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL the first company operating across the entire automotive circular economy value chain, with the aim of engaging the automotive industry in moving towards resource neutrality.

Bringing together all the expertise and all the industrial and technological assets linked to the circular economy existing in the Group and its partners, THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL offers closed-loop recycling solutions at every stage of a vehicle’s life: supply of parts and raw materials, production, use, and end of life.

To carry out its activities, THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL relies on a wide range of technical skills, from advanced engineering and chemistry to the use of data, which it places at the heart of its business model to optimize the economic and environmental performance of its solutions. THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL also offers the automotive sector a consultancy service, as well as training courses dedicated to the circular economy, with the support of the Industrie Circulaire de la Mobilité (ICM) campus based in Flins as part of the Group’s ReKnow University.

The new legal unit THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL will be implemented between the end of 2022 and 2023.

Reducing the consumption of virgin materials is a key objective, both on an ecological and economic level. The extraction and processing of raw materials have negative impacts on ecosystems and reduce their availability for future generations (see 4.2.2. “Risk of failure in supply of raw materials” paragraph). At the

same time, the rising trend observed in raw material prices since the beginning of the century and their volatility affects the profitability of the business. Circular economy principles reduce the Group’s exposure to

Refactory, the first European circular economy plant dedicated to mobility

In November 2020, Renault Group announced the creation of the Refactory at its site in Flins. This project is part of the Group’s transformation strategy and builds on its pioneering commitment to the circular economy. It aims to develop a competitive industrial model for sustainable mobility, based on the value-creation potential generated by a vehicle throughout its life. The roll-out of the new activities, initiated in 2021, will continue until 2025.

The Refactory relies on a large network of multi-sector partners (start-ups, academic partners, major groups, local authorities, etc.) and is structured around four areas of activity.

ReTrofit: This division combines all the activities making it possible to extend the life of vehicles and their uses, in coordination with the Re-Cycle division, to ensure efficient management of the flow of used parts and materials within the company on a single site. Since the end of 2020, it has included a UV Factory for the reconditioning of used vehicles with a capacity of 45,000 vehicles per year, to which a new heavy body shop will be added in 2023 to repair up to 25,000 vehicles involved in an impact per year.

A ReTrofit activity for the conversion of thermal vehicles to other less carbon-intensive energies is also planned, starting with the ReTrofit of electric motors for MASTER commercial vehicles. Announced in mid-July 2022, the partnership between Renault Group and Tolv (formerly Phoenix Mobility) is the first collaboration between a non-specialized vehicle manufacturer and a start-up in the ReTrofit sector. The partnership is a proof-of-concept project with the aim of launching a future commercial offering.

This will be supplemented by fleet repair services, particularly for car-sharing.

ReEnergy: The aim of this division is to scale up innovative applications using electric vehicle batteries and new low-carbon energies: assessment and repair of electric vehicle batteries, dismantling of end-of-life batteries and reuse of their components, development of second-life applications such as stationary electric energy storage, industrialization of hydrogen fuel cells and charging infrastructure forlow-carbon vehicles.

ReCycle: This division, including the remanufacturing workshops transferred from the Choisy-le-Roi site, will bring together various activities contributing to the efficient management of materials: dismantling of end-of-life vehicles, reuse and renovation of automotive components, closed-loop recycling of materials from the various Refactory divisions and the INDRA network.

ReStart: To promote and develop industrial know-how, but also to accelerate research and innovation in the circular economy, this division will house an incubator as well as a training center dedicated to circular economy professions. It will also include an advanced manufacturing activity with ReTrofit services forindustrial robots and production of parts from 3D printers.

Metals and plastics make up more than 85% of the materials in automobiles. In 2022, vehicle production (2.1 million units) at the Group's plants and parts suppliers required approximately 2.7 million metric tons of steel, 185,000 metric tons of cast iron and 270,000 metric tons of aluminum. These estimated figures include offcuts of

sheet metal and

metal shavings generated during

supplier parts manufacturing processes and in Renault’s plants. In addition, Renault Group used about 350,000 metric tons of plastic materials, including offcuts, in vehicle manufacturing in 2022.

Among the materials used in the plants in the Europe and North Africa Regions (approximately two thirds of the

quantities above), it is estimated that the portion of recycled steel materials ranges from 17% for flat steel to more than 90% for steel bars and cast iron. The recycled materials rate

02

for aluminum varies considerably according to the processes used to manufacture the parts: it is nearly 100% for aluminum foundries and secondary smelting and nearly 40% for pressed

aluminum parts manufactured internally.

The average mass of recycled plastics for all vehicles produced in Europe, Turkey and North African in 2022 is approximately 19 kg per vehicle. For new vehicles, put into production in 2022, this same average rises to 23 kg.

Renaultis a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and member of the RECORD network

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation works with businesses, universities and decision makers to promote circular economic models and develop the scientific and managerial knowledge required for their adoption and to advise on the potential for economic and environmental benefits.

As a founding partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Renault contributes to its funding, supports the work and events coordinated by the Foundation and develops activities based on the principles of the circular economy, such as the Refactory and the activities of Renault Environment.

Renault anticipated the European regulatory requirement whereby 95% of vehicle mass should be recyclable or recoverable and implemented it on all models brought to market starting in 2007. In addition, it has been voluntarily applied to all Group vehicles sold worldwide.

Accordingly, since the early 2000s, the design of Renault taken dismantling and

vehicles has recycling requirements into account. For example, disassembly is made easier by reducing the number of attachments. For example, dismantling has been made easier by reducing the number of fixing points. Similarly, preference is given

to recyclable materials for which recycling systems exist; whenever possible, a single part will not contain materials that cannot be recycled together; and tanks are shaped to allow all fuel and oil to be removed. During the design phase, every new vehicle project is monitored by a recycling specialist.

Renault also participates in research projects aimed at developing new recycled and recyclable materials recyclables (see example of the DECORE Project in the box in paragraph 2.3.2.2.6 Recycling).

The possibility of renovating powertrains or certain of their parts (remanufacturing) is also taken into consideration from the beginning of their design by facilitating the dismantling and assessment of their components.

Renault Group is also working at reducing the amount of materials used in manufacturing its vehicles.

Reducing our dependence on rare earths

Since permanent magnets often contain rare earths, the Group has moved toward engines that do not contain them where possible. Since 2011, for its 100% electric vehicles, the company has chosen externally excited synchronous motors, a technology without permanent magnets and therefore requiring no rare earths.

In addition, when feasible, the Group chooses materials other than rare earths in its magnets, for example, ferrite for applications such as speakers.

Renault Group is also reducing the use of the most critical rare earths through technological innovations. For example, the Group’s consumption of Dysprosium (a heavy rare earth) decreased by 65% between 2011 and 2016. The Group strives to replace heavy rare earths (more critical in terms of supply) with light rare earths when possible.

Lastly, Renault is working on projects to recycle rare earths with the aim of reducing its dependence on the extraction of these minerals even further.

O

In accordance with the principles of the circular economy, Renault has adopted a preventive approach to achieve the maximum reduction in the environmental impacts associated with waste, through the implementation of the following principles, in order of priority:

● reduce the quantity of waste generated at source, by first eliminating the source of its creation, where possible: this means that the use of sustainable packaging in the transportation of manufacturing parts is favored over that of single-use packaging, particularly for high-volume parts and short logistical flows (the economic and carbon assessments incorporating the return of empty packaging are not favorable for low volumes transported over long distances).

When the production of waste cannot be avoided, we seek to reduce the amount by separating the portion that is not waste per se. There are several solutions, such as dehydration of sludge from the painting process and water treatment plants, separation of reusable oils from sludge and machining chips, etc.). For example, the installation of a 3rd evapo-concentrator at the Cléon plant in early 2020 made it possible to reduce the tonnage of hazardous waste by around 10%;

● reuse spent products, production offcuts and scrap: in

assembly

plants,

excess anti-corrosion protection

waxes are recovered after application, filtered and returned to the production system. Following the implementation of regeneration of solvents used to rinse the painting robots on most sites, the reuse of these regenerated solvents in the paint lines is now in place at the Batilly, Maubeuge, Flins, Sandouville (France) and Valladolid (Spain) sites. In Colombia, the Medellin plant has been recycling its paint solvents internally since 2014, enabling the plant to eliminate almost all solvent waste. As regards powertrain manufacturing sites, the Cléon plant collects and regenerates used stamping and

25 Environmentalreporting scope described in appendix 2.6.1.3. 26 See table at the beginning of chapter 2.3.2.2

● recycle the materials contained in the waste. This form of waste treatment can be applied to most recoverable materials (cardboard, plastic, metal, etc.). In this way, metallic waste, which represents over 70%25 of the total production waste, is almost 100% recycled. Paper, cardboard and plastics are also systematically sorted

for recycling. However, beyond these “traditional” recyclable waste categories, some more complex types of waste that may initially appear of no value can also be recycled through incorporation in the composition of new materials. In 2022, the Group exceeded its 2023 target of reducing non-recycled waste per vehicle26. The resumption of production and

the improved performance of several high-impact sites led to this strong improvement.

●

recover energetically:

● by using waste as an alternative fuel: as an example, the site at Flins, since 2017, has been sending part of its hazardous waste to a facility for the preparation of substitute solid fuel (SSF) supplied to cement works as an alternative to fuel oil for the combustion units;

● or by recovering energy from its incineration to produce electricity or steam; this in turn can be used to replace natural gas for heating paint drying ovens, as is the case at the Sandouville plant in France and the Busan plant in South Korea;

● dispose by burning waste (without energy recovery) in incineration facilities or burying it in landfills. Renault is seeking to minimize the use of this waste management method. Based on a like-for-like scope of operations, Renault reduced the amount of manufacturing waste sent to landfill (except demolition and foundry waste) by 75% from 2022 to 2023). Between 2013 and 2021, this rate was -67%.

To ensure consistency at a Group-wide level, Renault has drafted a waste table (a codified list of waste produced by sites). This makes it possible to standardize the approach to hazardous and non-hazardous waste internationally.

Collection is an essential step in the recycling of end-of- life products. In addition to its regulatory obligations, Renault has chosen to invest directly in the collection and processing networks for ELVs (end-of-life vehicles) in France (45% of the Group’s European end-of-life vehicles are located here due to Renault’s long-term establishment in the country) in order to retain economic and technical control of materialflows.

In 2022, Renault created “THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL,” which aims to bring together all the existing expertise of the Group and its partners in this activity. This new entity offers short-loop recycling solutions at every stage of a vehicle’s life: supply of parts and

raw materials, production, use, and end of life, with the ambition of taking recycling into a new era and becoming the European leaderin the automotive circular economy.

In concrete terms, THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL relies on its subsidiary Gaia, whose activities in battery repair, collection and reuse of parts, and recycling of materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELV) are based in Flins, but also on INDRA and BOONE COMENOR, experts in the recycling of metal scraps from the industry.

Since 2008, together with its key partner Suez, Renault has held a 50% stake in INDRA, the leading ELV processing company in France, which has a network of 380 approved ELV centers.

Renault Group’s investment in these activities through “THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL” has four objectives:

● to meet Renault’s regulatory requirements concerning ELV collection and processing in France;

● to improve the technical and economic performance of

the network, thereby achieving in a cost-efficient manner the European goal of 95% vehicle recycling and

recovery rate, through the development of new dismantling tools and processes for ELVs, and

supporting and training its automotive dismantling network;

● to feed recycling closed loops (see the “Recycling” paragraph below) in order to reduce dependence on and consumption of virgin raw materials;

● THE

FUTURE IS NEUTRAL also aims to become a European leader in short-loop battery recycling, in line regulations, and attractive to other vehicle manufacturers through the operation of a first-class industrial process in terms of efficiency and purity to ensure the required level of recycled content in their batteries at the best cost. To develop Europe’s first short-loop battery recycling offer, the entity relies on the largest fleet of electric vehicles and high-content chemistry and capitalizes on INDRA’s expanding network to help with battery recycling and Gaia’s expertise for their diagnostics.

INDRA has been active in automotive dismantling for more than 30 years and is now fully aligned with this new era, working at all levels of automotive dismantling through four complementary areas of activity:

● engineering: INDRA designs, develops, produces and markets innovative tools, equipment and processes (refined and tested at their own dismantling site in Romorantin) deal with ELV

that decontamination, dismantling and recycling. These tools and methods are intended to be widely disseminated within INDRA’s network of ELV Centers, but also internationally INDRA develops and delivers training programs through its AURECA Training Centre created in 2021 (nearly

1,000 people trained by 2022);

● management/distribution of ELV for manufacturers, insurers, governments and even individuals through its 380 authorized ELV centers (+7 between 2021 and 2022);

● dismantling/recycling in its own dismantling centers;

● sale refurbished parts

of under Indra

warranty:

distributes certified, reusable parts dismantled at its sites through its network.

According to data available at the date of publication, around 450,000 end-of-life vehicles were processed in 2022 by Indra’s network of authorized ELV Centers or by its own dismantling sites, including more than 25,000 via the goodbye-car.com website, which offers a “turnkey” ELV collection service aimed at retail customers.

The subsidiary Gaia collects unused parts in the sales network as well as at the plants and suppliers’ facilities, sorts them and, depending on their condition, directs them to reuse, remanufacturing or, failing that, to the most appropriate recycling system.

In France, Renault has offered used body parts (including hoods, wings, headlamp units, etc.) collected and selected from Indra’s network of dismantlers since 2012.

To facilitate access to refurbished parts, Indra has also developed the PRECIS system, in partnership with Sidexa. This was put into service in France in 2014 and enables a pooled inventory of premium quality refurbished parts for repairers to be created, supplied by the Indra network demolishers. When pricing the repairs to be carried out on vehicles, repairers are automatically informed by the PRECIS module of Sidexa’s Pacte Office software (market

leader in calculation software) of the existence of refurbished parts available in the pooled inventory. This reduces the cost of repair while maintaining the same level of guarantees. This offer allows the restoration of vehicles at a lower cost, including those for which repair would not have otherwise been economically viable using new parts alone, thus extending the vehicle life while very significantly reducing the environmental footprint associated with the repairs.

The deployment of PRECIS continued to progress, with all 140 dealers in the Indra network connected. PRECIS is also

continuing to penetrate the networks of automotive brands and independent coach builders who use Sidexa’s costing solutions.

In 2022, Renault Group strengthened its partnership with PRECIS to facilitate its network’s support for the tool and thus contribute to the increased use of reused parts by repairers. This activity still has significant potential for growth, given the continued low penetration of used parts in the repair market.

Lastly, Renault Group also gives a second life to the batteries of its electric vehicles, which can be reused at the end of their first life on the vehicle and before they are recycled: the subsidiary Mobilize and

develops implements with its partners numerous non-automotive energy storage applications (see section 2.4.1.1.A).

2.3.2.2.5. Remanufacturing and reconditioning

MATERIALS

For more

than 70

years,

Renault has been remanufacturing: the refurbishment of mechanical parts. Used parts are collected in the sales network, sorted and refurbished. Between 1949 and 2022, the renovation of engines and manual gearboxes was carried out at the Choisy-le-Roi (France) factory. In the first half of 2022, the Choisy-le-Roi factory’s activities were integrated into the Flins Refactory.

This activity adheres to a strict industrial process: complete

involving dismantling, cleaning, sorting, refurbishment and replacement of faulty or worn parts, reassembly and inspection. Parts that cannot be reused during renovation undergo closed-loop recycling in Renault Group foundries.

These renovated “Standard Exchange” parts are sold to Renault and Dacia vehicle owners at a price that is, on average, 30% lower than that of a new part, while satisfying the same quality requirements. Far from being marginal, the standard exchange parts offering covers powertrain parts mechanical parts, and electronics and is regularly extended to cover new parts categories.

In accordance with the principles of the circular economy, Renault’s objective is to ensure not only that waste from

the automotive industry is recycled but, whenever possible, that it is recycled within the automotive industry itself (closed loop). The challenge is to maintain the technical qualities and economic value of materials during recycling.

At end-2022, the short-loop recycling networks set up by Renault included:

● recycling of copper: the wire bought back from the dismantlers of end-of-life vehicles by GAIA is processed to recover the copper. The copper is then resold either to the Fonderie de Bretagne (Renault Group) for the production of pearlitic cast iron or to auto industry suppliers for aluminum processing. The copper recycled by GAIA is of a high-quality, enabling it to meet demanding technical specifications and to replace virgin or post-industrial material;

● recycling of polypropylene (plastic material): GAIA collects bumpers from dismantlers and garages and ensures that they are processed in order to meet the Alliance’s

Renault-Nissan technical grades of polypropylene provided by this recycling network have been listed with the Renault Materials Panel, of which three are used for mass production applications and four are currently awaiting approval for new vehicle projects;

specifications. Seven

● recycling of metallic waste from manufacturing (sheet metal, shavings from machining). Loops between Renault plants or between Renault plants and suppliers of metal parts have been set up in France, Spain and Brazil;

● recycling of platinum-group metals. Gaia collects catalytic converters from end-of-life vehicles from dismantlers, from which it extracts the platinum-group metals. These recycled metals are then sold to an auto industry supplier to be re-used in the manufacturing of catalytic converters.

These closed loops contribute to the achievement of Renault’s objectives for the use of recycled materials in new collection and vehicles.

The transportation of materials during the recycling process are also optimized to achieve the greatest reduction in the environmental footprint of the recycled materials.

The Group regularly develops new ways of reusing materials end-of-life

from vehicles, notably through collaborative research projects bringing together manufacturers, local authorities, public players and universities (see DECORE Project box below for example).

DECORE project (Decarbonization of the Coct and Recycling/Reconditioning)

Led by equipment manufacturer Faurecia and with the participation of Renault as a pioneering manufacturer in the circular economy,the DECORE consortium focuses on three major areas:

● Designing new materials based on recycled and/or bio-sourced materials for the Interior and Seats scope;

● Developing car cockpits made ofrecycled (or bio-sourced) and recyclable materials;

● Extending the life of vehicles through reconditioning and upgrade solutions.

This consortium aims to provide:

► from 2022, concrete solutions to reduce the carbon footprint and increase the use of recycled and/or biobased materials;

► and, by 2030, cocts with newly developed technologies, with a carbon impact of -85% compared with 2019 and incorporating 40% recycled or biobased materials.

Supported by the government as part of the Investing in the Future Program (PIA), this project benefits from the commitment of the public authorities and the control of BPI France’s programs to develop technological expertise in France related to carbon neutrality and the circular economy.

The other members of the consortium are the CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial research organization, and MTB RECYCLING, an SME recycler and equipment manufacturer since 1981 and an expert in complex waste management.

The consortium also relies on numerous partners, sector and scientific players (Next move, PFA, Collège de France, etc.) who will contribute to transforming vehicle seat and interior modules toward a circular economy.

● disseminating the Group’s best practices on the reduction in the consumption of solvent paint products and the associated emissions, led by the Group’s Paint Engineering Department;

● implementing or replacing VOC-processing incineration facilities where necessary.

In 2022, the continuation of the electronic components crisis weighed on the VOC indicator, with a negative effect due to two main causes: the non-proportionality between the drop in production volumes and solvent consumption and the successive shutdowns/restarts requiring the use of solvents for cleaning and purging facilities. Despite this deterioration in production conditions, the reduction actions made it possible to achieve the expected target. The actions to reduce VOC emissions in the Group’s plants during 2022 included:

● installation of robotic equipment for certain bodywork paint and coating tasks, which enables much finer optimization of the quantities of products used;

● introduction of indicators at certain sites to optimize sealant and paint consumption and therefore reduce emissions at source (continuation of the deployment initiated in 2021, with, for example, the optimization of the paint application rate in Cordoba);

● perpetuation of actions undertaken to improve the recovery rate of used solvents (cleaning and purging solvents) at all sites (e.g. installation of manual purge boxes at the Busan site this year).

All of these actions made it possible to achieve a Group emission level of 31.84 g/m² (for a target of 32 g/m²). At end- 2022, more than 80% of vehicles produced were painted with water-soluble base (i.e. the solvent in the paint mainly consists of water)27 .

During the 2000s, Renault Group completed a large-scale program to replace fuel oil with natural gas in the thermal power stations of its sites to cut emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In addition, from the 2010s onwards, investments were also made to replace the high-power boilers at the sites with decentralized low-power boilers, close to the production facilities, thereby optimizing the power output and limiting heat losses in the networks. Currently, the main focus is on the modernization of gas boilers and the installation of low NOx-emissions burners. SO2 emissions decreased from 36 metric tons in 2010 to 4.1 metric tons in 2022. NOx emissions decreased from 597 metric tons in 2010 to 333.8 metric tons in 2022. 28

All vehicles sold by Renault Group worldwide have from the relevant

received appropriate

approval

authorities in accordance with all regulations in force. Following the widespread deployment of particulate filters for diesel vehicles, as imposed by the Euro 5 standard, the Euro 6x standards lowered the authorized particulate emissions levels for all engines while reducing by more than half, compared with Euro 5, the authorized limits of nitrogen during (NOx)

oxides emissions laboratory testing for the approval of diesel vehicles (from 180 to 80 mg/km for diesel), bringing them closer to those allowed for petrol vehicles (60 mg/km). (see appendix 2.6.1.7 for details of thresholds for the various standards)

Such a reduction was made possible by the implementation of post-treatment systems such as NOx traps or SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction). The NOx trap is a chemical system that traps nitrogen oxides to allow them to be reduced to neutral gases. It has been fitted to certain diesel passenger cars sold by Renault Group in Europe since (Selective

September 2015. The SCR Catalytic Reduction) technology works to reduce nitrogen oxides into water and nitrogen by injecting urea.

At the same time, the identification of significant differences between emissions measured in real use and in

the

laboratory or approval led the European Commission to define a real-use test protocol, introduced with

the Emissions Euro 6d-temp standard (RDE, Real Driving protocol). Without waiting for these new standards, Renault Group had, starting in July 2015, studied the implementation of improvements on all of its Euro 6b diesel production aiming to further limit emissions in customer use. These improvements were gradually rolled outfrom August 2016 on the diesel vehicles in the range.

The roll-out of Euro 6 standards is a major step forward in the

reduction of pollutant emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles. As mentioned above, these standards have introduced measurements under real and driving conditions of

variable (RDE protocol) the emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides or particles in addition to the measurements made in the laboratory based on the standardized test cycle. By nature, these cannot cover the very wide variety of customer usage: driving and weather conditions, driving style, vehicle load, etc. This is why Renault, for several years, has supported the European approach aiming at

under real driving implementing measurements conditions (RDE protocol) in addition to implementing the

198

new WLTP laboratory test procedure, more representative of average customer use and the diversity of vehicle equipment than the NEDC cycle.

The adaptation of Renault Group vehicles to these new standards required an ambitious program of investments and development.

The Euro 6d temp phase has been applicable since September 2017 for new models (new types) and since September 2019 for all new vehicles (all types) (see Appendix 2.6.1.7). The

European Commission simultaneously introduced the

new laboratory test procedure, WLTP, which has been applicable since September 2017 for new models and since September 2018 for all new vehicles.

The final Euro 6d stage came into force between January 2020 (new types) and January 2021 (all types) for passenger vehicles and in January 2022 for commercial vehicles.

In order to meet Euro 6d temp and Euro6 d final standards, SCR technology, which Renault has used on its TRAFIC and MASTER commercial vehicles since the Euro 6b standards, has been fitted to the entire range of diesel passenger cars in Europe. This SCR technology, more constraining in use, with the installation on the vehicle of a urea tank to be refilled regularly, can nevertheless reduce nitrogen oxides with increased effectiveness over an extended engine operating range. For the final Euro6d stage, the diesel emission treatment was

system enhanced with a second SCR system to improve NOx treatment efficiency even more across all engine operating ranges.

For the petrol engines in the range, the tri-functional catalysis system simultaneously treats the oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the reduction of nitrogen oxides. The various stages of Eurox standards have been achieved by improving the engine settings and the load of precious metals in catalysts. From the Euro 6d-temp stage onwards, direct fuel injection engines have been fitted with a particulate filter. As with diesel, this filter allows a drastic reduction in the number of particles emitted by vehicles. With the Euro6D final stage, all petrol engines have been fitted with a particulate filter.

In other markets, Renault adapts the technical definitions of its powertrains to fit local specifics (fuel quality, climate, dust, etc.) in such a way as to ensure each vehicle’s compliance with applicable regulations in the country in which it is sold. In addition to strict regulatory compliance, the Group capitalizes on lessons learned in Europe to fulfill the growing expectations throughout the world, that pollutant emissions during customer use are better taken into account and controlled.

Internal governance processes aim to analyze and control discrepancies between the consumption and emissions values certified in the laboratory on a standardized cycle, and values measured during customer use:

● systematic measurement, for all models in the range, of emissions under real driving conditions using the “RDE” protocol (a “customer” driving cycle has also been used internally for many years to evaluate the consumption of our vehicles during use by the customer);

● analysis of differences between the results of these internal measurements, other measurements of the type

same taken by third parties (government commissions, NGOs, specialist companies such as Emissions Analytics® in particular) and the emission values certified in the laboratory on a standardized cycle, and cross-checking of this information against feedback gained from customer satisfaction surveys;

● monthly follow-up of the files brought up by market surveillance in a committee in charge of facilitating the treatment of questions relating to the conformity of our vehicles in terms of fuel consumption and polluting emissions. This committee is chaired by two members of the Board of Management: the Director of Corporate Engineering and the Director of Quality and Customer Satisfaction.

Cabin air quality

AIR

0000

Air in the cabin is a complex blend of air drawn from outside the vehicle, which supplies the heating and air conditioning systems, and emissions from materials within the cabin. Renault Group takes these two components

into consideration when designing its vehicles in order to control their impact on the quality of cabin air and to maintain the health and comfort of passengers.

Treatment of external air drawn into the cabin

AIR

A

0000

When driving, the main influence on the quality of cabin air is that of external air, given the fast air renewal flow required for passenger comfort (200 m3 /h on average). Therefore, as soon as it designs its vehicles, Renault ensures that the architecture enables an air treatment system to be fitted. Two types of technical solutions are implemented:

1. cabin particle filter (also known as a pollen filter): made of non-woven fibers, it is designed to trap the smallest particles, with an effectiveness of over 85% efficiency from 2.5μm in diameter and 95% for particles above 10μm;

O 2

Renault Group

Sustainable development

2. combination cabin filters: there are pollen filters with a layer of activated charcoal grains

added. In addition to particles, the activated charcoal traps gases, including aromatic compounds and nitrogen dioxide. These filters are sized to trap an average of more than 85% of these compounds on the Renault vehicles on which they are fitted.

The technical solutions applied to each vehicle are the result of

a compromise between of

a number requirements (treatment efficiency, defogging, noise and energy consumption), and vary according to range and equipment level. All passenger cars worldwide sold under the Renault, Dacia, Alpine and Renault Samsung Motors brands are fitted with a cabin particulate filter as standard. Most

of the

latest passenger car models marketed under the Renault brand in Europe come with combination filters as standard on all versions.

However, any Renault, Dacia or Renault Samsung Motors customer whose vehicle is not initially fitted with a technical air treatment solution from the outset and requiring such a solution will be able to obtain this equipment through additional Renault after-sales service.

Emissions from materials within the cabin

AIR

When the vehicle is stationary and exposed to sunlight, the presence of volatile chemical substance emissions from materials in the cabin may become overbearing when compared with the quality of the air outside. Renault has therefore set itself the objective of managing these emissions in order to minimize their impact on passenger health and comfort.

Thus, since 2009, all materials within all internal vehicle parts (cabin and trunk) whose total weight within the vehicle is over 100 g have been subject to specifications deployed to all relevant suppliers, in an effort to manage emissions levels from the main categories of volatile organic compounds.

Renault also ensures that any odors caused by the main contributors to the vehicle’s atmosphere are limited. This is assessed by a panel of experts who are specifically trained in Renault’s own methods, based on olfactory descriptors and an understanding of odor levels as set out by the methods of IAP-Sentic® , a consultancy firm specializing in odors (and a subsidiary of the Burgeap group).

This year, Renault Group achieved its objective of reducing the number of hazardous chemicals30 used on Group sites by 20% over six years (2016-2022) (and by 68% between 2010 and 2022). The Group has therefore set itself a new target: a 50% reduction between 202131 and 2030.

Protecting the health of workers and consumers as well as ecosystems led legislators to impose restrictions on the use of hazardous substances in the workplace and in products. Starting in 2003, the European automotive industry has largely eliminated the use of heavy metals as a result of the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive (2000/53/EC). In

the

European

Union,

the introduction of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals

(REACH 1907/2006) regulation heightened awareness of chemical risks and prompted an increase in the number of restrictions and utilization precautions. Many countries around the world follow the with

in 2007

EU similar regulations. Efforts to improve the protection of human health and the environment are also being promoted at the global level by the United Nations, in particular in connection with the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) and the International Panel on Chemical Pollution (IPCP). Other regulations that are less relevant to the automotive sector are also emerging, for example in relation to biocides or cosmetics.

Renault Group has an organization dedicated to the management of dangerous substances, capable of taking into account regulations on substances as well as proactive anticipation policies. The

three divisions devoted to this activity support the roll-out of initiatives in Renault Group’s day-to-day processes:

● in collaboration with the departments responsible for occupational

health and working conditions, the Industrial

Hygiene and Chemical Risks Division manages workers’ exposure to chemical risks at all Renault Group production, engineering and logistics sites around the world. It monitors the chemicals present in the formulations delivered to Renault Group and verifies the classification and labeling of the chemical products used on site and also ensures compliance with the Product Safety Data Sheets provided by suppliers. It provides an initial assessment of the chemical risk in accordance with generic use conditions. In addition, it alerts and coordinates the engineering centers and the sites if products containing priority risk substances are used so that they can look for technical solutions to eliminate them. Finally, it carries out monitoring work on chemicals within the environment through the collection of samples and the analysis of the pollutants present at workstations.

This expert division was created in the 1960s;

30 Chemical products classified as “Priority 1” (PR1) by Renault for replacement. This category includes products containing category 1a/1b CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic) substances or substances listed in Annexes XIV and XVII of the European REACH regulation in concentrations higher than the thresholds defined by Renault standard 00-10-050 on prohibited or restricted substances.

● the Materials Engineering division controls the use of substances in vehicle design and anticipates the banning of the most substances several years before they are banned by regulation. It monitors substances contained in vehicles based on information declared by suppliers using the IMDS (International Material Data System) system, shared with 35 international carmakers. It enables Renault Group to meet the information and transparency obligations under regulations (REACH, the European directive on waste, and now the financial directives). It steers the search for alternative technical solutions enabling the elimination of priority risk substances by relying on relays within each branch of mechanics, after-sales),

(vehicle, and engineering

reinforces this approach with its counterparts both within and outside the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. It defines and steers compliance actions in the concerned entities, anticipates default risks upstream of the supply chains and designs ways to transform regulatory constraints into economic and competitive opportunities;

● the After-sales Regulatory Compliance Division checks with suppliers that parts, accessories and other products sold teams

by after-sale comply with applicable regulations and make any substitutions, if required.

As part of a preventive and pre-emptive approach, since the 1960s, Renault Group has been replacing substances identified as toxic and hazardous to the environment found in the chemicals used at its plants and, since the early 2000s, those found in materials used. Renault has drawn up two lists of substances prioritized for replacement, for chemicals and materials respectively, which comprise, in particular, CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic) substances, substances of very high concern and subject to prior authorization (appendix XIV of the REACH regulations), as well as substances whose use is not yet restricted, but which Renault Group would like to see banned at a global level.

These two lists are respectively described in two separate standards: Renault Group’s standard 00-10-050 “Substances” for chemical products and standard RNES- B-0027 common to Renault and Nissan for automotive parts. These standards ban the use of hazardous substances and substances of concern, list substances for which substitution is a priority, and require suppliers to declare the substances and

used in their parts preparations. In calls for tenders, Renault Group explicitly asks suppliers to comply with these standards. Their application is enforced by each of the three competent divisions.

In line with regulations, Renault adheres to a policy of transparency toward its professional and private customers.

In addition to

standard substances and those with identified risks, Renault Group pays close attention to the potential health effects of innovative materials, such as nanomaterials.

NOISE

0

Noise is a complex subject that involves a wide range of factors such as type and power of noise sources by octave band, directivity, the impact of buildings, topography of locations, weather, etc. For the comfort of residents living near its production facilities, Renault takes noise measurements at the property line that exceed regulatory requirements.

The Group makes active efforts to limit and reduce noise pollution from its activities by working to control “noise” at existing and new facilities, right from the project phases, regardless of whether they are linked to a new vehicle or a new building. The Group aims to do this by conducting extensive studies on the

impact of noise (3D modeling), by selecting high-performance materials with this

goal in mind, and by implementing soundproofing measures. These measures are focused on all types of extraction chimneys, boilers, metal drops and logistics-related activities, which generally constitute the main sources of external noise across our industrial sites.

NOISE

0000

All vehicles marketed by Renault in Europe in 2022 have road noise emissions of 72 dB(A) or less32, in accordance with European regulation 540/2014/EC. The vast majority also comply with the 70 dB(A) by the second phase of this regulation, applicable to all vehicles produced since July 2022. The Group is already preparing for the third phase, which will lower the permissible level for most passenger cars

to 68 dB(A) in July 2024. This includes work on improving tire noise, engine acoustic radiation and insulation and exhaust system attenuation.

With a certified noise level well below 68 dB(A) Renault electric vehicles already meet the limits applicable starting in July 2024 nearly two years in advance, thus contributing to the reduction of ambient noise and the quality of life in urban areas. In addition, they produce a net improvement in users’ comfort: the noise inside an electric vehicle is approximately 10 dB lower than that of an internal combustion engine vehicle.

At the international level, the regulations concerning vehicle noise are most often

based on European regulations, possibly adopted a few years later. The vehicles marketed by Renault Group outside Europe, which have noise levels comparable to their European versions, therefore often anticipate locally applicable regulations by several years.

With the exception of certain versions of the Kangoo, Trafic and Master vans, as well as the Alpine A110 and Megane RS sports cars, which are in separate categories from the rest of the range and are subject to specific noise emission limits.

The 2019 IPBES33 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warned of an unprecedented and increasing rate of species extinction. This report identified and ranked the five direct drivers of change in nature with the largest relative global impacts: (1) changes in land and sea use; (2) direct exploitation of natural resources; (3) climate change; (4) pollution and (5) invasive alien species.

Study of dependencies and impacts

Based on the method of a specialized consulting firm, Renault conducted an of

Group

analysis

the dependencies and impacts of its activities on biodiversity and ecosystems.

Dependencies: Renault Group identified dependencies of its activities on ecosystem services throughout its value chain. The main ecosystem services needed for Renault’s business model are the following:

● water, mineral and biotic and abiotic energy supply services;

● climate regulation, water and waste treatment services;

● cultural services.

Impacts: Through its own activities, its value chain and the use of its products, Renault Group contributes, to a greater or lesser extent, to the 5 pressures on global biodiversity identified by the IPBES.

In addition to this first study, in order to better understand the impact of its own activities on biodiversity and ecosystems, the Group set in 2021 the target of having 20 preliminary biodiversity assessments conducted by 2023. These analyses will be entrusted to specialized consulting firms. As of the end of 2022, this target was exceeded: a total of 21 preliminary assessments had been conducted

at

the greatest

sites with

the

perceived stakes (prioritization of sites located close to natural sites and/or with a large proportion of natural surface within its land area). This work highlighted the ecological sensitivities of each site and identified actions to encourage biodiversity at our sites.

Of these 21 preliminary assessments, 5 highlighted important issues, including the presence of protected species such as the amphibian vole, the marsh epipactis and the brown howler monkey.

Commitments and actions

Renault Group joined the act4nature initiative in 2018 to contribute to the

protection, enhancement and restoration of biodiversity. The Group is thus committed to avoiding, reducing and offsetting its impacts, aiming for no net loss or a net gain of biodiversity.

In 2021, prepared a positive initial assessment of the progress of its initiatives and stepped up its actions in favor of biodiversity. These new public

Renault Group

commitments are S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Additional, Realistic and Time-bound) and are recognized by the act4nature steering committee of companies, business networks, environmental NGOs and scientific bodies.

In our own operations

To reduce

the footprint of its own operations on biodiversity, Renault Group applies specific protection measures.

Industrial projects involving the construction or extension of plants are assessed to measure their impact on existing ecosystems. For example, in 2022, as part of a project to extend the car park at the Maubeuge site (France), a characterization and delimitation of wetlands was

launched to assess the feasibility of the project. Biodiversity issues are therefore taken into account in projects, and the Group has integrated biodiversity protection into its internal environmental guidelines applicable to all sites, regardless of local regulations.

At the Curitiba site in Brazil, Renault devotes 37% of its space (2.5 million m2 ) to protecting a primary forest area. This virgin forest, made up mainly of araucaria trees, a species of pine threatened with extinction and protected under Brazilian law, is home to more than 170 species of animal.

Regarding the industrial and tertiary sites, the HSEE Department produced guides containing actions that can be deployed at all the sites to protect biodiversity. They

are based on assessments. Roll-out is underway.

In 2022, 15 of the Biodiversity project pilots completed the “Fresque de la biodiversité” training.

Outside our own operations:

● Natural rubber: Since 2019, Renault has been a member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), an initiative aiming to improve the environmental and socioeconomic performance of the natural rubber sector, which notably includes actions to fight against deforestation. In 2022, Renault Group:

● published its Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy, a set of commitments aligned with the objectives of the GPSNR;

● gained a seat on the platform’s executive committee;

● finances,

alongside Michelin, an “Agroforestry Capacity Building Thailand” project. This field project aims to engage, by 2025, 1,000 smallholder farmers producing natural rubber in southern Thailand. The objective is to reduce the environmental impacts of plantations while increasing the economic resilience of farmers, notably improving their food security.

● Biobased materials: In 2022, Renault Group has adopted a Biobased Materials Strategy to ensure that the expected gains in terms of carbon footprint reduction do not lead to undesirable effects on humans and such

ecosystems, as competition with food, deforestation, loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity, pollution. We require

and potential suppliers to demonstrate that risks have been identified, assessed and controlled. Each proposed material must now be approved by a dedicated internal committee.

● Strategic ores: In 2022, Renault Group joined a group of NGOs, scientists, and companies calling for a global moratorium on deep-sea mining until it is scientifically proven that it can be done in a sustainable way. The oceans

and

their

ecosystems play a crucial

role

both in climate regulation and in generating livelihoods for women and men, (Details: https://www.noseabedmining.org/).

● Occasional tree-planting actions. For example, in 2022 in Spain, the Renault Foundation collaborated with the Natural Heritage of the Castilla y León Region to organize the planting of more than 2,000 trees near the Valladolid factory. The factory’s employees and their families (about 200

people) took part in this reforestation. This action will help to improve the region’s plant biodiversity and thus strengthen the existing animal species. In Colombia, efforts are being made to reforest the Salto de Tequendam forests. The “El Granja El Porvenir” project entrusts this task to women from the communities around the sites. By creating a new source of income, the project helps to build the economic resilience of the participants and enables them to acquire new skills while contributing to a local environmental issue.

Sustainable development

Beyond these specific measures in our own operations and outside, protecting the biodiversity of species and ecosystems also requires reducing pollutant emissions in ecosystems (air, water, soil: see 2.3.2.3.1, 2.3.2.4.2, and 2.3.2.4.3), reducing pressure on resources and forests, producing less waste (see 2.3.2.2), and reducing

greenhouse gas emissions Renault’s (see 2.3.2.1).

continuous efforts and the

and quality EFPD8a EFPD11a

WATER

0000

0

Preserving water resources is an ongoing concern for Renault, both to ensure long-term supply and to reduce its impact on ecosystems. For this reason, the Group has set a goal of minimizing the impact of its activities on this precious resource through the implementation of the following five objectives:

● reduce water consumption at source as well as the quantities of wastewater

through well-designed processes and optimized management. For example, in vehicle surface treatment, which is one of the major causes of water consumption in an automotive plant, the principle of reverse-cascade rinsing of baths and stopping the rinse water flow between each body (which limits contamination from one bath to the next by carryover) enable a reduction at the source of the quantities of water used as well as the waste to be treated;

● reuse water where possible for the same use: cooling in a closed circuit, increasing the lifespan of baths (to reduce the draining frequency), etc.;

● recycle water for other compatible uses, with or without additional treatment. For example, the Sofasa plant (Colombia) recycles saline concentrates from reverse osmosis water to the flushing of toilets and the water curtains (air cleaners) of paint pits, which facilitates the reduction of the quantity of water consumed as well as that of waste discharged;

● minimize the

impact of residual

waste on the environment through efficient and strictly controlled treatment processes;

● control the risk of accidental pollution of surface water by installing the means needed to confine water from accidental spillages and that used for firefighting. Since late 2015, the Tangier plant, designed not to discharge any industrial waste, has accordingly had a basin that enables it to confine any accidental pollution and avoid

204

its discharge into the environment and to treat rainwater drained on the site by decantation.

Reducing industrial effluents

Among measures used to meet its objectives of reducing water abstraction and the discharge of pollutants into the environment, Renault

places

a particularly strong emphasis on the recycling of industrial effluents: the wastewater generated by the manufacturing process is treated in a manner that allows this same water to be transformed into a resource of sufficient quality to be re-used in the same process.

In the powertrain plants, the recycling of industrial effluents consists in separating the distillate that can then be reintroduced into the process, from the concentrate (loaded with oil) that will be directed to the appropriate waste treatment channel.

In the body assembly plants, the recycling technology is more complex because the water used in the

manufacturing process

(surface

treatment and electrocoating) must be of very high quality. The treated waste is subjected to a reverse osmosis process (a membrane-based water demineralization process), then an evapo-concentration process (high concentration effluent through

of different

evaporation stages), allowing most of the water to be reused in industrial processes and minimizing the quantities of waste generated.

The Tangier body assembly plant in Morocco is equipped with the most advanced technologies available for recycling wastewater from the manufacturing process. Following the additional investments made in 2015 to increase the volume of industrial effluents recycled and thus keep pace with the increase in the site’s production rate, the volume of water saved amounted to nearly 280,000 m3 per year on average. The Tangier site is the plant with the lowest external water supply ratio (at 1.5 m3 per vehicle produced in 2020) in accordance with the target assigned when it was founded.

Another lever that has been implemented in the bodywork factories is the modification of

vehicle surface the

treatments in paint departments. It consists of replacing the products used with products containing fewer toxic metals (removal of nickel). This change has reduction of Nickel

environmental benefits: flows discharged outside our sites and reduction of water consumption in the surface treatment process.

Since 2021, two factories have already implemented this change, and a third is planned for 2023.

Financial statements

The ongoing crisis in the supply of parts (including electronic components) continued to weigh on the water consumption indicator per vehicle, with a level of production of vehicles and mechanical components equivalent to 2021. The frequent, and sometimes

prolonged, breaks in production activity once again impacted the operation of industrial processes (such as surface treatment and cataphoresis lines), generating a large number of treatment bath emptyings, as well as

more frequent cleaning/disinfection of

sensitive equipment (air cooling towers, domestic hot water circuits) from a health risk point of view (legionella). With a still significant "heel" effect due to the overcapacity of the Group's industrial sites compared with the volumes produced in 2022, the external water supply indicator per vehicle produced remains at a high level at 4.7 m3 /vehicle.

For the second year, the discharges of toxic metals from the Group’s industrial activity are monitored by the indicator summing the quantities of Zinc and Nickel reported to the vehicle produced. These two substances are the main metals emitted during surface treatment activities aimed at the anti-corrosion treatment vehicles. On all industrial vehicle production sites, physicochemical treatment methods are implemented in order to reduce the quantities of metals released. The purification performance of these water treatment facilities is regularly monitored. The change in process mentioned above (modification of the surface treatment) will also contribute to reducing nickel emissions at source.

Soil and water tables are environments that can potentially allow pollution from past activities to come into contact with targets to be protected (humans, natural environments, etc.).

SOIL 0000

Renault has therefore implemented a policy to prevent pollution of these environments and, when past pollution is suspected, implements specific management strategies. This policy is applied to all Group facilities presenting a potential pollution risk, i.e. operational industrial facilities, former industrial facilities converted to other uses, as well as the Renault Retail Group (RRG) commercial network. Renault aims to maintain in-house skills in prevention of soil pollution and remediation.

In 2022, the manufacturing sites, as well as the main engineering, logistics and head office sites of Renault Group34 represented a total area of 3,848 hectares, of which 48.8% are impervious areas such as buildings, parking lots, roads and paths. Total surface area and the proportion of impervious surfaces did not change significantly from the previous year, at constant scope.

Prevention

The prevention policy at industrial sites is based on three key tools. A risk-rating grid is used to assess the level of pollution prevention and reinforce it if necessary by prioritizing required rehabilitation work. In the case of new production facilities, the soil prevention guide describes the best techniques to implement in each type of facility. Both of these tools are in use across all Renault industrial sites worldwide. The prevention policy ultimately relies on monitoring of the quality of groundwater. This monitoring, which is carried out systematically when regulations so require (all industrial sites in France), is also carried out voluntarily by Renault when potential sources of are pollution identified, to spot any movement of pollutants to sensitive areas and to take appropriate measures as early as possible.

● a historic and documentary study, including an analysis of the site’s vulnerability, was conducted for operational industrial sites, former industrial sites converted to other uses and the RRG commercial network. It is updated as necessary. This study enables the identification of potential sources of pollution and the evaluation of the vulnerability level at the facility and in its immediate surroundings;

● a physical diagnostic analysis of the soils is conducted based on the results of the historic and documentary research;

● if the diagnostic analysis confirms the presence of pollution sources, a quantitative evaluation of the health risks is performed in order to assess the exposure risk for site users and the immediate surroundings (workers, residents, school children, etc.);

● remediation operations may be started depending on the results of the two preceding steps. These operations are carried out by specialized service providers with recognized expertise, under the supervision of the Renault soil specialist.

RRG uses the same assessment method to clean contaminated soils on former oil and fuel storage sites, even when this contamination is due to the former owner.

2.4.1 Toward sustainable, safe and inclusive mobility EFPD14a EFPD16a

Although access to mobility remains a major aspiration and a necessity for millions of people worldwide, technology and the ways in which vehicles are used are changing rapidly with its electrification and the gradual move from an economy of ownership to an economy of use.

These new forms of mobility are dramatically changing business models and uses.

Carmakers alone cannot redefine and shape tomorrow’s mobility. This is why Renault Group works closely with various players who also take on the subject: local and regional authorities, start- ups, companies, universities, etc.

Objective: to offer solutions tailored to each individual’s needs.

2.4.1.1. A “Made in Renault”

and ecosystem innovation for sustainable mobility EFPD14a

Renault Group has been committed to the development of large-scale electric mobility for more than 10 years. A pioneer in Europe, it announced the launch of a complete range of four affordable 100% electric vehicles in 2009. Promise kept from 2011. Since then, it has been renewing and expanding its offering with electrified models whether hybrids, plug-in hybrids or 100% electric. All new models launched in 2022 are either electrically powered or equipped with an electrified (hybrid) engine.

The Group’s objective is simple: to make electric mobility accessible to all by meeting everyone’s needs.

Electric mobility is the best immediately available response to accelerate the energy transition, fight against climate change and improve air quality in cities.

A. More than 10 billion “e-kilometers” already traveled Renault and electric vehicles represent more than 10 years of unparalleled experience and expertise, validated by more than 10 billion “e-kilometers” already covered. Renault Group, EV pioneer, currently stands as one of the market leaders in Europe. Today, it is a revolution that is picking up pace. Renault is ready to take part, not only because of its experience in this field, but also as a “long- established vehicle manufacturer.” Its know-how in the design and start of sales of vehicles, the experience and density of its network to market with the best advice and to maintain and repair these vehicles, combined with its electrical know-how is a unique blend of the past and the future that allows us to support this acceleration with confidence.

The Renault brand thus offers a complete range of electric vehicles. Renault offers four passenger cars in Europe with E-Tech Electric technology: Twingo, Zoe, Kangoo and Megane. Driving New Megane E-Tech Electric means benefiting from a reinvented experience where, thanks to an agile platform dedicated solely to electric power

(the Alliance’s CMF-EV platform), a dynamic powertrain (new to

powertrain 160 kW of power and 300 Nm of torque). Driving pleasure is omnipresent, in perfect alchemy with comfort. Without compromising safety, range (up to 470 km range according to the WLTP standard) and charging performance thanks to innovative solutions applied to both the 40 and 60 kWh battery packs. Renault Megane E-Tech Electric has had a promising commercial start, with more than 40,000 orders already placed since its launch, 75% of which are for premium versions and 85% for the most powerful engine. The Renault brand’s range of electric vehicles will be strengthened in the B segment. The Renault 5 Prototype is a forerunner of a B-segment saloon, which will be launched in 2024. 4EVER trophy, revealed at the 2022 Paris Motor Show, is a forerunner of the B-segment SUV, planned for 2025. These two vehicles will be based on the unprecedented CMF-BEV platform and will enable Renault Group to offer affordable electric vehicles.

In terms of commercial vehicles, Renault also offers a wide range with the Kangoo van and the Trafic and Master vans.

In line with its ambitions to achieve a mix of more than 65% electrified vehicles in the sales mix by 2025, Renault is

increasing its share of electrified sales by +9 pts versus 2021. The E-Tech range

(electric and hybrid) now represents 39% of Renault passenger vehicle sales in Europe in 2022, while the market average is around 31%

Launched in spring 2021, Dacia SPRING, the Dacia brand’s first electric vehicle, brought in almost 100,000 orders. Dacia Spring was the 3rd-most sold 100% electric model in Europe overthe first three quarters of 2022.

For Renault Group, the electric vision goes far beyond the car, which is why it created a fourth brand in January 2021: Mobilize.

Mobilize’s ambition, through a very comprehensive integrated offering, is to contribute to a sustainable world by providing financial services, mobility services, as well as services related to energy and data.

Building on partner ecosystems that are complementary to our own, the brand wants to provide concrete solutions to promote ecological transition and develop more accessible mobility for people and goods, whether in complex, congested urban environments or in rural areas.

Mobilize’s strength lies in its comprehensive offering of mobility, energy and data. Knowing how to deal with these three subjects means optimizing technological solutions and therefore costs... toward zero carbon.

With Mobilize, Renault Group is positioning itself in the new world of mobility and is committed to achieving carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040.

Examples of Mobilize’s contributions:

In the field of mobility, Mobilize encourages the transition from ownership to use.

Mobilize is developing two car-sharing solutions with this in mind: Zity by Mobilize and Mobilize Share.

Zity by Mobilize is a ‘free floating’ carpooling solution (no need to return to the starting point)

The vehicle fleet is 100% electric.

An app allows you to locate, unlock, and drop off the vehicle and, of course, pay for the rental.

Zity by Mobilize is present in cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants (currently Madrid, Paris, Lyon, and Milan) and is aimed at people who have an immediate need for transport for a short journey (a few minutes/ kilometers).

Mobilize Share is complementary to Zity by Mobilize and addresses different uses that can last longer (up to one month).

Mobilize Share can cover:

● all the mobility needs in the dealership: replacement vehicles, test drives, short-term rental, etc.

● non-concession mobility solutions, such as car-sharing in the city, with a partner or directly within a company.

This car-sharing service is a closed-loop service (the starting and ending points are the same) for small and medium-sized cities. It can start with only two or three vehicles.

208

Mobilize Share relies on its partner Glide, a start-up in the Mobilize ecosystem providing:

● on-board technology (car-sharing box);

● off-board technology (app and back office);

and an operational team that supports professionals in the deployment of this activity.

The “Mobility 360” project, created with Uber, RATP and BlaBlaCar, brings together experts who intend to use their complementary expertise and coordinate their approach

to propose simpler, greener, sustainable and shared mobility solutions for cities and citizens.

● In the field of energy, the ambition is to make the electric vehicle part of everyday life.

An electric vehicle can be charged intelligently when electricity is cheapest and least carbon-intensive, and it can also become an energy source. This is the “vehicle-to- grid” (V2G) system.

The energy stored in the car’s battery is fed back to the grid when there is a surplus. For example, a vehicle could supply energy to the city grid when the need for electricity is greater than the supply and eventually supply the house with energy.

Mobilize also develops innovative solutions to extend the life of electric vehicle batteries.

Mobilize has entered into an agreement with Betteries, a German start-up with a strong commitment to the circular economy, to develop and assemble a mobile, modular, multi-use energy system consisting of battery modules from electric vehicles. Easily transportable, this system is made up of one to four elements (betterPacks) of 2.3 kWh and can thus reach a capacity of 9.2 kWh, equivalent to the average consumption of a household over a day. It offers the advantage of being zero-emission and silent and points to the energy transition from transportable electric generators to clean and mobile electric systems.

There are multiple uses and applications of this system when connection to the electricity grid is impossible, such as construction sites, food trucks, solar energy storage, filming and events. The manufacture of this innovative storage system began in 2022 at the Flins Refactory.

This plant is where Mobilize is primarily developing energy storage solutions with the Advanced Battery Storage project. It is the largest stationary energy storage device. Ultimately, the project is set to reach a capacity of 70 MWh across France and Germany.

After the plant in Douai (North of France) and Elverlingsen (Germany), Mobilize has chosen to install 480 unused Renault Zoe batteries at the Refactory in Flins (Yvelines, France) for an additional capacity of 15 MWh.

The Group has also formed a partnership with Compagnie Seine Alliance and the integrator GreenVision to electrify a fleet of boats on the Seine using second-life batteries of Renault electric vehicles.

As a pioneer in the development of “Smart Islands”, Mobilize innovates to provide territories with a range of solutions and achieve carbon neutrality.

After Belle-Ile-en-Mer (France) and Porto Santo (Portugal), the aim now is to convert the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha into a “smart island”. With electric cars, charging stations powered by solar panels, and a way for excess energy to be sent back to the grid, Mobilize has implemented an energy management system designed to preserve nature and help the local community.

B. Innovation developed through our strategic

partnerships

The automotive industry is undergoing fundamental changes. Customers are moving away from owning a vehicle to using mobility services. Territories are taking the initiative to develop new modes of mobility that are environmentally friendly, efficient and inclusive. Vehicles are increasingly electrified, which creates new needs and constraints for their users. With the creation of the Mobilize brand, Renault Group is fully committed to supporting these changes, the

with ambition simplifying the lives of users of mobility services and being a leading partner for the territories.

of

According to the UN, in 2050, the global population will reach 9.8 billion people, with almost 70% living in urban areas compared with 55% today, representing 2.5 billion additional city dwellers. This forecast gives an indication of the immense challenges to be faced in terms of quality of life, inclusion, urbanization, housing, transport and healthcare in cities, as well as accessibility to these new forms of mobility outside of cities.

In terms of mobility, new uses and new technologies are spreading, questioning the place and status of individual cars ownership. The market is increasingly being structured according to uses of consumers, who are looking less for ownership of a vehicle, than for a multimodal, innovative, connected,

more ecological

offering suited to the diversity oftheir needs.

The city of the future will be smarter, more inclusive, more connected and more collaborative. Vehicles that are clean, silent and shared will travel through it. Personal vehicles will share the road in the cities, as well as in rural areas, with new forms of services based on usage: carsharing, carpooling, on-demand vehicles (private-hire vehicles, taxis, etc.) as well as robot vehicles.

Today in Europe, several car-sharing services operated by Group partners use Renault electric vehicles. Renault Group is the leader in electric car-sharing in Europe. More than 12,000 electric vehicles are available to carsharing users in most European capitals as well as in sparsely populated suburban and rural areas. The Group adapts its offering to the context and offers both free-floating and closed-loop solutions.

The car is already electric and connected: tomorrow it could also be autonomous, with the benefits of smoother, more fluid traffic and improved safety. The development of autonomous cars and shuttles will accelerate the growth of electric, autonomous and shared mobility services. They will promote complementarity between modes of transport, multimodality and make the overall

system cleaner, safer, more accessible, more effective and more efficient.

02

Since 2017, Renault Group has been working with both public and private partners to experiment with Renault Zoe Cab prototypes for on-demand, electric, autonomous, and shared mobility services. The objective of these programs is to learn the needs of users and territories within an ecosystem of mobility services. They are part of France’s national SAM project (Safety and Acceptability of Autonomous Driving and Mobility) responding to the EVRA (Experimentation of Autonomous Road Vehicles) call for projects from the ADEME (French Agency for Ecological Transition) in connection with the Investing in the Future (PIA) program.

Following a first phase of lessons learned led by Mobilize and the Research

Department, the Paris–Saclay Autonomous Lab experimentation program underwent its second phase in 2022 with an extension of their field of experimentation and an opening up to new uses with optimized Renault Zoe Cabs. User-panelists were able to register, take advantage of this experimentation and share their feedback through a set of evaluations included in the national SAM (Safety and Acceptability of Autonomous Driving and Mobility) program.

C. An innovation designed with public players

The city of tomorrow will be innovative and adaptable while being respectful of the environment. The growth of the urban population comes with countless challenges: developing urban mobility while limiting pollution,

providing solutions to climate change and for society’s ecological transition, optimizing

water energy

and management, improving the quality of life of people, contributing to social cohesion, designing, building and renovating buildings and neighborhoods.

Renault Group contributes to collective thinking on sustainable mobility systems in cities and particularly on mobility ecosystems.

Led by the Research Department in cooperation with greater Rouen, the EV4all project aims to offer a package of solutions (existing and/or innovative) to decarbonize the everyday mobility of modest households living in rural areas.

The detailed analysis of these populations led to the conclusion that a small electric vehicle, equipped with a 20-kWh battery, would cover their daily needs, especially since rural housing allows easy access to an electrical outlet.

Beyond technical sizing limited to what is strictly necessary, the challenge is also to devise financial solutions for access to these vehicles without any initial contribution by proving their economic interest for the households concerned and for the “operator”. Various schemes involving greater Rouen, employers and the combination of new and second-hand vehicles are being evaluated. The goal is to build attractive proposals before the forthcoming widespread implementation of low- emission zones (ZFE) in French cities.

The Institute for Sustainable Mobility (IMD): meeting mobility challenges around the world

In July 2009, Renault Group and six ParisTech schools signed a partnership agreement to create the Institute for Sustainable Mobility (IMD).

Co-directed by Virginie Boutueil (Deputy Director of the Laboratoire Ville Mobilité Transport at the Ecole des Ponts) and Patrick Bastard (Director of Research, Renault Group), the Institute is a dynamic research community and a breeding ground for talent that relies on teams from the following French engineering schools: Ecole des Mines, École Polytechnique, Télécom Paris, Chimie Paris, Arts et Métiers, and École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. Each of these prestigious schools contributes the skills oftheirlaboratories and research teams.

The annual budget granted to the IMD by Renault allows theses in fourthematic areas to be funded:

● organization of mobility:

● understanding interactions between territories, infrastructures, and the various modes of transport;

● identifying emerging systems with high potential;

● analyzing

frugal solutions for essential mobility

services.

● mobility business models:

● specifying the viable economic models in the making (including cohabitation with the current models and alltypes oftransport);

● snalyzing the evolution of the automotive sector and its governance Innovating within wider ecosystems effectively; ● improved recharging performance and, in particular, in the of case long distances (technology and user experience).

● innovating within wider ecosystems effectively.

● environment: Industrial, energy, and materials sectors:

● identifying the international conditions for transforming the current automotive value chain towards alternative energy

vehicles and new mobilities;

● evaluating the impacts of the development of the sectors (including Hydrogen) on the environment (climate,resources) via life-cycle analysis;

● reinforcing exchanges with partners, communicating, and positioning.

● disruptive technologies:

● identifying the disruptions linked to technologies (electrification, electricity storage, driving assistance, and

etc.)

the of resulting from

requirements

sustainable, responsible, and inclusive development;

● highlighting how technological developments in infrastructure (physical and internet) can impact the mobility ecosystem.

The IMD’s research areas are defined jointly by Renault engineers and researchers from the various laboratories in the academic network.

The research work can take various forms: bilateral contract between Renault and a laboratory, doctoral

Renault’s long-term commitment allows it to undertake multi-year research programs, some of which capitalize on real expertise over very long periods. One example is the mobility observatory, which, year after year, accumulates a wealth of information on mobility in major cities around the world. This means that around 100 major cities and thousands of factual data points can be used as a basis for studies on optimizing urban mobility.

02

In addition to the ongoing studies, here are some concrete examples of studies discussed in 2022:

● EV scale-up comparison: Norway/China;

● European experimental & innovation policies;

● ecosystem learning about mobility/energy, circular economy in Europe;

● conditions for monetizing data with third parties?

● linking the service/hardware/SW cycles to maximize the value/cost ratio for Renault and the company;

● dynamic of spreading

innovation, exuberance and enthusiasm in mobility services;

factors of

● efficiency of mobility modes: which areas are relevant for cars?

● air quality: supporting local mobility policies;

● EV services and impacts Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); ● simplified LCA tool;

● ESG materials and technology choices;

Some of these studies have already been launched. Others will be launched in 2023.

While IMD has produced many results since its creation, it has also allowed the recruitment of excellent engineers, thus contributing to the transformation of Renault around two strong objectives:

1. from the car to mobility services;

2. towards sustainable and responsible mobility within the territories in our various markets.

VeDeCom Institute – Zero-carbon communicating vehicles

Renault is one of the founding members and an associate donor of VeDeCom, one of the IETs (Institutes for Energy Transition) set up as part of the French government’s Investment Plan for the Future (Plan d’investissement d’avenir). It is supported by the NextMove and several local authorities (Yvelines Departmental Council and the Versailles Grand Parc and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines city authorities).

VeDeCom is an institute for shared and co-located research into autonomous

electric, and connected and

Sustainable development

Renault Group’s road safety policy and actions are based on four main focuses (prevent, correct, protect, and rescue) that allow us to take action before, during, and after an accident:

02

PREVENT

Prevention involves helping drivers to anticipate risks. Part of the solution consists of helping the driver by assisting with the driving task (driving aids). The remainder lies in encouraging more responsible driving. Drivers need to understand the limits beyond which they will be incapable of controlling their vehicles, and the situations in which they are putting themselves at risk.

PREVENT

CORRECT

CORRECT

The quality of road handling and braking constitutes the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. They are fundamental to avoiding accidents. Nevertheless, there are situations where technology should intervene to compensate for driver error. This is the purpose of these active safety systems. They intervene in difficult or emergency conditions; however, they do not do entirely replace the driver.

PROTECT

网

PROTECT

A top priority of Renault Group’s road safety strategy is to protect the car’s occupants according to the nature and severity of the impact, regardless of their age, size or location in the vehicle, in small and large cars alike. Renault thus equips both the front and rear seats of its vehicles with systems to provide optimal passenger protection. The protection of otherroad users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) is also taken into account.

ASSIST

+

RESCUE

Renault Group collaborates with French and foreign emergency services to optimize help for accident casualties. These services receive guides and attend information sessions explaining how to perform rescue operations on each new Renault vehicle. They are also provided with late-model vehicles on which they can practice victim extraction methods. Innovative modifications are applied to the brand’s vehicles to ensure that emergency firefighter interventions are safer and more effective.

2.4.1.2.1. The Renault Group policy for road safety EFPD16a

Renault Group is committed to safer mobility, both for the occupants of its vehicles and for all road users

(pedestrians, cyclists, etc.). Renault Group relies on the research of the LAB (laboratory for accident research and biomechanics) to constantly and concretely improve the safety of its products and services. For more than 50 years, the LAB has provided world-renowned scientific expertise to observe, analyze and anticipate.

Founded in 1969 as an EIG (economic interest grouping) by the two French manufacturers PSA SA and Renault Group,

the LAB the is laboratory for accident research, biomechanics and human behavior studies.

Its strength is based on varied, complementary skills in the service of

safety:

engineers,

data scientists, biomechanics experts,

physicians, engineering psychology experts and field accident investigators. In 2022, LAB experts participated in Horizon 2021

a European collaborative project

(V4SAFETY), management of a European industrial project (ENOP), and participation in two projects of the Interministerial Delegation for

Road

Safety (DISR) THORAX).

(USCOMA

and

The EU-funded(1) V4SAFETY (Vehicles and VRU Virtual eValuation of Road Safety) project will provide a framework for managing safety measures – from in-vehicle safety technologies, new vehicle types and infrastructure solutions to regulations that influence the behavior of road users. The framework will include methods for projecting results into future scenarios and across EU regions aimed at policy makers, authorities and consumer organizations.

The ENOP (Enable New Occupant seating Position in automated vehicles) project involves 10 industrial and academic partners (Renault, Stellantis, Toyota, Cellbond, Faurecia Automotive Seating, Autoliv Development AB Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen (BASt), CEESAR, ICAI-Comillas Pontifical University, LBMC-Gustave Eiffel University). Its purpose is to better understand and model the biomechanical constraints of the occupants, in unusual positions that could be adopted in highly automated vehicles.

First detect: Following the model of the eco-score already introduced in our range, the new Renault vehicles will offer a Safety Score to analyze driving habits and provide driving advice adapted to each individual. The principle is simple: based on data from the vehicle’s sensors driving criteria that are easily understandable because they are based on rules from the traffic regulations will be developed in order to establish a driving score from the point of view of safety and behavior. Designed in partnership with the Ecole de Conduite Française and soon to be offered on our new vehicles, the safety score will have the advantage of enabling drivers to identify

areas for improvement to help them adopt a more preventive driving style and thus act to reduce driving risks and, as a result, contribute to the improvement of road accident research.

Then guide: in real time, data from the vehicle’s sensors and connected systems will alert and advise the driver by signaling surrounding or upcoming risks on the on-board screens

(dashboard and multimedia screen). The combination of the navigation system and maps allow the driver to be informed in real time when approaching risk areas to encourage more careful driving as they move closer to them. All of these functionalities, grouped together in the safety coach, are designed to advise the driverfor safer driving.

Under certain conditions, we will also take action on speed, which accounts for more than one third of fatal accidents. Safe Guardian adapts the vehicle to anticipate and prevent dangers.

All new models approved between mid-2022 and mid- 2024 (passenger vehicles and small commercial vehicles) are equipped the following as standard equipment:

● an AEB (Advanced Emergency Braking) system to reduce the risk of a rear-end collision;

● an Emergency Lane Keeping system to alert and correct for unintentional lane departure;

● an Intelligent Speed Assist system to alert the driver if the legal speed limit is exceeded;

214 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

●

a Driver Drowsiness & Attention Warning system to detect decreased alertness and warn the driver based on an analysis of actions;

● a Reversing Detection system to detect the presence of an object in the rear field of the vehicle.

The maximum speed of the vehicles will also be limited to 180 km/h.

The commitment to automotive safety has resulted in the achievement, 26 times, of the maximum rating of 5 stars in Euro NCAP tests, after having been the first vehicle manufacturer to do so in 2001 on the D segment (Laguna II in 2001), then on the C-segment (Megane II in 2002) and lastly on the B-segment (Modus in 2004). This cross- disciplinary approach has been enriched by taking into

account new issues related to the compatibility of vehicles in frontal impact and the phenomenon known as submarining, which is now taken into account in certain new NCAP protocols. This year, two new models, Megane E Tech and Austral, were awarded five stars.

The effort in the field of passive safety will continue over the coming years, particularly supporting the tightening of rules for consumer testing around the world.

While efforts in passive safety undertaken by the entire automotive industry have enabled extremely significant improvements to be achieved in terms of reducing the road death toll, recent technological advances, complementing public policy, have heralded a new and very promising area of progress, meaning that it is no longer a case of limiting the consequences of an accident, but rather, of reducing their severity, or even, avoiding them altogether.

This is where primary road safety comes into play, with ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). These ADAS can alert the driver to danger, assist with corrective maneuvers brake when or collision

is imminent, supporting the driver if he or she has failed to react. These systems, the most

typical today being Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), will be able to act on one of the recognized causes of accidents to reduce their occurrence and severity: the driver’s delayed reaction due to a lack of attention or anticipation.

Renault’s ambition is to improve the safety of all its vehicles through driver assistance systems.

In 2015, ESPACE was the first in its range to feature these new functions, which are already to be found in other C and D-segment vehicles: KADJAR, TALISMAN, MEGANE IV and KOLEOS. The preparation of new systems is underway, benefiting from the very rapid progress in the development of sensors and embedded electronics. In 2016, SCENIC unveiled a new generation of even more powerful ADAS systems, including Automatic Emergency Braking with pedestrian detection, which is found on most of our products.

Renault Group makes a total of 13,150 educational videos (17 languages and 22 countries) presenting the functionalities and technologies of Dacia and Alpine brand vehicles, including ADAS, available to customers. This total includes the 5,900 online ADAS tutorial videos (Renault and Dacia BUs), i.e. around 45%.

The website https://www.e-guide.Renault.com/portail/ has received 3.5 million visits since 2017 and the tutorials, available in 17 languages and 22 countries, have been seen nearly 17 million times. Renault is innovating in the way it communicates about ADAS by offering immersive virtual reality tools to explain how research works for the benefit of safety.

PROTECT with the LAB’s expertise

PROTECT

Since 1969, PSA and Renault Group have been advancing road safety with the LAB. It is a major contributor of scientific publications in its field. It has made major advances in road safety – knowledge of human behavior and tolerance levels of all sorts of people (age, size, gender, position, etc.) – and is helping manufacturers to design future technologies to increase safety for road users.

Thanks to the LAB, Renault has:

● Reinforced front impact structures and integrated pre- tensioning systems that have made it possible to lower shoulder belt tension and improve the complementary relationship between the belt and airbags to reduce injury risks. Plastic parts that may be in contact with the occupant have been designed to limit the applied forces;

● Reinforced side impact structures and integrated side airbags protecting the chest and head. Plastic parts that may be in contact with the occupant have been designed to limit the applied forces;

● Enhanced seat and headrest

behavior to prevent whiplash in a rear impact;

● Improved child protection with Isofix attachments to properly position dedicated child seats;

● Modified the design of the front of vehicles to improve pedestrian protection.

RESCUE with the Rescue Code, Rescue Sheet and Fireman Access

RESCUE

“In a

violent accident

with

severe

trauma

to the passengers, the ‘golden hour’ is the critical time after the impact. Every minute counts. Our primary objective as firefighters is to save time in all phases of our interventions.” explained Christophe Lenglos.

Formalizing a long-standing relationship with the fire brigade (2010), Renault Group works regularly at the national level with the Department of Civil Security and Crisis Management (DGSCGC) and with the French National Federation of Fire Fighters (FNSPF). As the only manufacturer to be a member of the World Rescue Organisation (WRO), a committed partner of the NGO Pompiers de l’Urgence Internationale (PUI) and involved on a

daily basis with the fire brigade in 12 European countries to better understand their needs and facilitate their work in the field, Renault Group has built a unique collaboration. It can be seen in, in addition to other actions, the donation of several hundred overhauled vehicles per year dedicated to road rescue training and the creation of the position of a lieutenant-colonel of firefighters integrated within our staff to support the project teams and to provide dedicated training to fellow firefighters. Renault Group contributed to the drafting of the national road rescue intervention doctrine document.

Fireman Access makes it easier for firefighters to deal with battery fires in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The battery fire is extinguished after five minutes instead of

nearly two hours on a high-voltage battery not equipped with it. Fireman Access is a heat-meltable part placed on the chassis of an electric vehicle that, in the event of a malicious vehicle fire, allows the jet from the fireman’s hose to access the 400-volt battery underneath, which itself is equipped with fireman access next to the chassis fireman access. The aim is to drown the battery by filling it with water, which is the only way to turn off a lithium-ion battery on fire quickly and permanently.

Renault Group is currently the only carmaker to offer this technical solution to firefighters.

The

traction battery disconnection system (HV) is positioned directly on the battery in order to guarantee complete electrical safety for all those involved, including the emergency services.

The Rescue Code on the windscreen and rear window of our vehicles allows firefighters to immediately identify the model a vehicle involved in an impact at the accident site thanks to a QR code that gives access to the rescue sheet providing useful information on the architecture and systems that can impact them in their efforts. In the event of a serious accident, this speeds up passenger assistance

by nearly 15 minutes and increases the chances of survival of victims by 50%.

Closer look at actions in 2022:

● implementation of design studies to ensure the best position for the service plug and fireman access on future electric and hybrid vehicles in the Renault range. Emergency service needs are taken into account from the design stage of vehicles. For example, fireman access is already integrated into all our electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles: Zoe, Zoe Long Range, Kangoo Z.E Long Range and Master Z.E, Twingo Electric, Megane Electric and Spring Electric, Captur plug-in hybrid and Megane plug-in hybrid;

● systematic installation in the factory of the Rescue Code on new Renault 2022 models;

● monitoring and ensuring that the Engineering Department takes into account the first rules of design relating to emergency firefighter interventions on our hybrid and electric vehicles;

● systematic verification of the appropriate performance of our electric and hybrid vehicles in the event of fire;

● organization of free training sessions to share our knowledge of alternative energy vehicles with the rescue community; 13 training sessions took place in 2022, including 6 for foreign firefighters, some with the strong support of the countries’ subsidiaries. In 2022, 880 firefighter trainers benefited from this sharing of information, which then could then pass on to their colleagues;

● organization of a seminar on electric vehicles dedicated to firefighters, bringing together 300 rescue workers and some 20 engineering specialists to share the latest technical information;

● active participation in the Euro NCAP’s consideration of firefighter interventions following accidents in order to define the future Rescue protocol for 2026;

● donation of more than 400 latest-generation vehicles to the firefighter services of France and Europe in 2021 to help improve their road rescue training;

● rescue sheets for each of the Group’s new models, in partnership with the road rescue advising firefighters of the Ile-de-France regional group. This unique method ensures that the content of our sheets perfectly meets the needs of emergency services;

● contribution to the organization of the World Rescue Challenge by providing the competing teams with new- generation vehicles.

All vehicles comply with the regulations in force in Europe and outside Europe.

Europe:

● all new passenger car models are equipped with six airbags, seatbelt pretension/restraint in front seats/ central rear seats and at least two Isofix cables in the rear. There are also seatbelt reminders for every seat in the 1 st and 2nd rows;

● already in place on our fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, Fireman Access will continue to be deployed

on all future electric and electrified models to allow firefighters to extinguish a burning EV as quickly as an ICE vehicle (the only OEM to allow this performance);

● rescue Sheet: technical guide for rescue teams; Renault was the first manufacturer to adopt the standardized format forthese documents in 2014.

Outside Europe:

● the deployment of standard passive safety elements is underway in line with the renewal of local range plans;

● in terms of active safety, in addition to passive safety devices, we intend to deploy and adapt systems that have already been tried and tested and are recognized for their effectiveness, such as emergency braking assistance, overspeed warning and lane departure warning.

2.4.1.2.2. Integrating new technologies

The will

vehicle of the

future

be zero emission,

communicative and driverless. The communicating vehicle is connected to other vehicles, to the road and to the environment. The vehicles exchange information about their location, speed, planned route, etc. They will also act as sensors for other vehicles, indicating traffic, road issues, etc. The information obtained will be used first and foremost to provide safety services (incident warnings for onward route, roads or areas with specific hazards, etc.) as well as traffic services (congestion, alternative real-time itineraries, etc.).

Vehicle autonomy is being phased in, starting with partial conditional

or autonomy depending on the driving situations envisaged.

Clearly one of the main challenges is to ensure the safety of all users on roads that are increasingly connected and automated. Renault Group therefore collaborates with the scientific community, industrial partners, and public authorities on all aspects of safety:

●

dependability;

● general product safety;

● regulatory compliance (technical and Highway code);

● compliance with the European Statement of Principles on Human-Machine Interface;

● development of international norms and standards;

● definition of possible applications for connectivity and

compatible with planned or

foreseeable usage, including any potential distractions; automation services

● compliance with the laws on personal data records.

The goal is to demonstrate this safety through six types of testing, to test and validate the performance and safety of the services and associated technical solutions:

● basic operational tests using

test

facilities

and simulations;

● operational tests on test tracks;

● operational tests on open roads with escort vehicles;

The connected vehicle was rolled out as part of the collaborative SCOOP@F project, which ended in late 2021. Partially automated Level 2 vehicles are widely deployed in the range with functionalities that aim to improve driving comfort and safety such as contextual cruise control (adapts speed to the legal speed and road geometry).

Renault Group is fully involved in the French collaborative SAM

program Autonomous Driving and Mobility, which brings together a consortium of industrial

for Safety and Acceptability of

and research players and regional partners. This program is in response to the EVRA (Experimentation of Autonomous Road Vehicles) call for projects launched by the ADEME (French Agency for Ecological Transition) in connection with the Investing in the Future (PIA) program in June 2018. The three-year project began in July 2019.

This program enables autonomous vehicle experiments to be carried out and contributes to the creation of a common asset for capitalizing on the driving scenarios necessary for their validation.

2.4.1.2.3. General product safety

In terms of general product safety, Renault Group has defined a general policy to be followed based on:

● A reference database of undesirable customer events considered potentially safety-related by the company. These events are systematically taken into account throughout the life cycle of the car. Operational dependability is taken into account in every project. Technical reviews and audits are organized to ensure the achievement of the target as recommended in ISO 26262. The new ISO 21448 published in 2022 is currently being deployed with the ADAS scope;

● The creation of safety documentation for each project (called risk and security control digital mock-ups), covering engineering, manufacture, sales and after- sales. It is created and validated according to specific rules and processes and signed by the Chief Engineer of the projectin question. In 2022, 215 FMRS were signed;

● Managers who, within the main functions concerned (engineering, manufacturing, quality), are responsible for ensuring the compliance of projects in terms of safety;

● Crisis management training sessions are offered to those in the involved within

Renault Group tool Learning@Alliance. In

2022, 550 employees were trained, 40% of whom were outside France.

2.4.1.3. Making mobility as widely accessible as possible

2.4.1.3.1. Affordability and physical

accessibility

Widely accessible spare parts

With regard to service, Renault Group developed a more affordable of

range

spare

parts to

make

mobility

accessible to the greatest number of people.

Starting in 1998, Renault offered a full range of parts equivalent in terms of safety and functionality to the original vehicle parts, whatever the brand. Since then, the offering has evolved to better meet the expectations of customers and markets. Renault offers an alternative service for its models over 4 years old in its network under the VALUE+ brand. This offering, exclusively dedicated to Renault and Dacia vehicles, is the best alternative to the original part with all carmaker services and warranties. As for the Motrio brand, it is adapted to the needs of all makes of vehicles over four years old and currently has 8,500 references divided into 70

different product families.

This range is compatible with 50 automotive brands and more than 500 vehicle models.

Currently, Motrio is present in around 50 countries worldwide and the brand even has its own multi-brand garage chain. Building on this success, Motrio is naturally continuing its international growth, and has committed itself to the crucial digital and e-commerce channels for closer contact with its customers.

For many years, Renault has also been developing alternatives to new parts. In 2012, Renault created an after-sales refurbished parts service. In anticipation of the requirements of the Royal law on the use of parts from the circular economy in automotive repairs (which came into force in 2017), Renault's sales network offers used body parts (hoods, fenders, headlamp units, etc.) in France and mechanical parts in France that have been collected and selected in Indra’s approved network of ELV (end-of-life vehicle) centers. This service is particularly of interest to

customers whose

vehicles

are not

economically

repairable using only new parts.

Finally, for more than 70 years, Renault has offered a standard exchange service, which involves the industrial refurbishment of mechanical parts such as engines, gearboxes, starters, compressors, steering columns, etc. In 2017, the service was extended to electronic parts with a range of refurbished multimedia systems. This new

business area is a major development area for the standard exchange service. The refurbishment electronic parts has been a natural addition to the refurbishment activities and is in line with both

218

of Qstomize, Group

technological developments and customer needs. The used parts are collected in the distribution network, sorted and refurbished according to a rigorous industrial process. These renovated (“standard exchange”) parts are sold to Renault vehicle owners at a lower price than new parts while satisfying the same quality requirements (see paragraph 2.3.2.2.4).

Renault pays particular attention to adapting its spare parts pricing to the change in the residual value of its vehicles in order to optimize their reparability. Renault initially focused its efforts on the bodywork segment. The cost of repair is an essential criterion for insurers to avoid premature scrapping. Thus, between three and six years after the date of launch, depending on the range, Renault concentrates its price reduction efforts on parts related to passive safety (airbags, seatbelts, dashboard, etc.). Likewise, from the cessation of marketing of vehicles, the price of bodywork parts (bumpers, doors, wings, etc.) and glazing is adjusted each year. Renault is going further by adopting the same approach for mechanical parts. The ambition is the same: to promote repairs by fully integrating the residual value of vehicles into the pricing of parts.

Qstomize: providing custom automotive solutions for everyone

Created in 2009, Renault Tech changed its name to Qstomize in 2022: a name that evokes its core business, namely the customization and transformation of vehicles, with a scope of action beyond the Renault brand and even the Group. At the same time, Qstomize presented its new strategy “Qstomize 2025: new ambitions, together,” which focuses on two main areas: the expansion of the product range and the geographical scope.

The Qstomize Business Unit designs, produces and markets conversions for Renault Group, Alliance and partner vehicles, for both professional and private customers, in compliance with Renault Group quality

standards. Qstomize is an integral part of Renault Group’s After-Sales Business Unit.

For more than 12 years, Qstomize has made people with reduced mobility a core focus of its concerns, offering them a complete range of adaptations to Renault vehicles and enabling them to travel in complete autonomy and safety whether for business or pleasure. Through Renault is the only European manufacturer engaged in the design, manufacture and start of sales of vehicles dedicated to transporting people with reduced mobility. Renault has also been a partner of the

Fédération Française Handisport (the French disability sports federation) for almost 20 years. https:// professionnels.Renault.fr/mobilite-reduite.html

Qstomize is also developing a complete range of conversions for passenger cars (special series, driving school vehicles, etc.) and for commercial vehicles (interior arrangements, vehicle protection, equipment kits, etc.). In addition, there are custom fittings for corporate fleets, specifically adapted to the needs of the customer.

All of these conversions are carried out at 13 sites near Renault Group factories in France, Spain, Slovenia, Turkey, Romania and Morocco.

2.4.1.3.2. A committed, socially responsible player

Although mobility is a key element for the social and professional inclusion of people,

millions of them nevertheless remain limited every day in their travel. Penalized by financial, geographical

and social hindrances, too many people have to give up a job or a training course quite simply because they cannot get there. According to a 2019 report by the court of auditors, “The main difficulties encountered by beneficiaries in accessing employment stem from the insufficient supply of jobs in the professional sector, a level of qualification that is too low (in almost half of the cases), the lack of a driving

license or vehicle (42%), discrimination accessing employment, and their financial situations...” in In France, among individuals living in a household earning less than €1,000 per month, 54% report that they had given up a job because they had no means to travel (source: “Mobility and access to employment” survey – January 18, 2017).

As a major player in mobility, Renault Group therefore decided to act for more inclusive and socially responsible mobility by setting up a social business program that aims to favor the mobility of the most vulnerable.

Caremakers: an inclusive mobility solution through a micro-loan offering

In France, the Caremakers Inclusive Mobility offerings enable economically vulnerable people to access or remain in the job market by providing new vehicles and after-sales services (repair and maintenance) at special prices.

For example, Dacia Sandero Essentiel is available from €45/month for a resident of the Greater Paris metropolis with the conversion premium (or €110/month without the premium) through a lease-to-own arrangement incorporating a micro-loan taken out with one of our partners. In 2022, we opened our offerings to the Dacia Spring, accessible from €40/month (all combined) or €130/ month. The Dacia Spring offers a 100% electric driving experience.

These offers are accessible either through a network of influencers (organizations, mobility platforms, social organizations, employment players) or directly on our website:

https://www.caremakersmobility.com/fr

They are valid in the network of Dacia and Renault “Garages Solidaires,” which are voluntary members of this program.

In 2022, between 700 and 800 vehicles were ordered and financed under the Caremakers program. On the strength of the satisfaction rate of this program and the initial very positive results of its impact on the improvement of the professional situation of its beneficiaries, Renault Group is committed to developing these offers in France and in other countries and is aiming for 4,000 LOAs in 2025, a tenfold increase in volumes in five years.

2. Financial investment in social businesses

Caremakers Invest S.A.S. has been offering funding and support since 2012 to innovative entrepreneurs developing mobility solutions for people in difficulty. Renault Group contributed €5m to this company’s capital.

Methodological note

The social performance indicators respond to the principal risks identified in the Extra-Financial Performance

Declaration (EFPD), in line with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017, successively amended

by Act No. 2018-771 of September 5, 2018, on the freedom to choose one’s future career, the anti-fraud Act No. 2018-898 of October 23, 2018, and Act No. 2018-938 of October 30, 2018, to balance trade relationships in the agri-foods sector and provide food that is healthy, sustainable and accessible to all, and Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017.

Consolidation scope

The consolidation scope covers the Group’s subsidiaries consolidated fully or corresponding to the definitions of a joint operation.

Several scopes are used in this chapter:

● global scope, excluding mobility start-ups, covering 99.8% of the Group’s workforce;

● fully consolidated subsidiaries (excluding mobility start- ups), covering 95.66% of the Group’s employees; the company that meets the definition of a joint operation is RNTBCI (India) for 66.67%.

Some indicators do not cover 100% of the consolidated scope notably due to data unavailability. The health and safety indicators cover 100% of the scope with the exception of mobility start-ups, Tandil, the Chinese sites of Nanchang JMEV and Shenyang RBAC, thus covering 99% of the Group's workforce. Compared with the 2021 scope, the following entities have left the reporting scope: Renault Moscow, the Avtovaz Group and its subsidiaries. Data collection

process, definitions and calculation methods for the indicators are set out in the Appendices concerning social commitment 2.6.2.

2.4.2.1. Health, safety, and ergonomics (HSE)

The commitments and actions relating to Health, Safety, and Ergonomics on the Group’s sites are detailed in the Renault Group Vigilance Plan, set out in section 2.2 of this document:

1. A mapping of risks, accompanied by methodology information (2.2.3.1);

2. Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of sites based on the risk mapping (2.2.3.2);

3. For each risk, actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements (2.2.3.3);

4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness (2.2.3.4);

5. A whistleblowing tool (2.2.6.1).

2.4.2.2. Promoting diversity, development and employee commitment

In 2022, Renault Group’s human capital comprised 105,812 women and men in the 121 entities and 35 countries in which it operates. Each and every one of them uses their commitment and skills to make mobility sustainable and accessible to all worldwide. Renault Group is committed to sustainable and responsible growth and implements a global, fair and competitive HR policy. HR principles, standards and processes provide a shared frame of reference, which ensures fairness and transparency for all employees. To continue to adapt to transformed roles in the automotive sector and to shape future mobility, the Group has introduced an HR policy with a global vision to ensure that Renault Group as a Company is fast-moving, innovative, effective and eager to learn. This policy is based on high-quality social dialog at both local and global levels, and is focused on five priorities:

● be sustainably competitive, while complying with codes of ethics and regulations to maintain employee health and safety;

● attract and develop all talent;

● implement management approaches that empower their teams;

● promote an inclusive culture;

● engage our employees and enhance their employee experience.

2.4.2.2.1. Ensuring the necessary resources and skills

At a time of digital revolution and the emergence of disruptive technologies at an increasing pace, the skills set needed by the company is changing. All levels of qualification are affected by these transformations. Moreover, identification of talent is taking place in an increasingly competitive market not confined to the automotive sector. To anticipate and adapt to these rapid changes, Renault Group recruits employees with a wide range of profiles and expertise in all the markets where it operates.

Sustainable development

A. Optimizing the allocation of resources

2022 was marked by a reduction in the Group’s workforce throughout the world. This decline, which can be observed in almost all entities of the Automotive Division, was mainly due to the adaptation of the production workforce

to market demand, for each product and region, and to the productivity efforts made at each industrial site.

Optimization plans have also been successful in reducing the indirect workforce, particularly in France, while shoring up the Group’s ability to innovate and develop the electric, connected, autonomous and shared vehicles of tomorrow.

* Expatriates are counted in their home country.

Figures for 2020 and 2021 have been restated; They exclude Russia and the Avtovaz Group.

As of December 31, 2022, the Group's workforce (permanent + fixed-term contracts), totaled 105,812 employees, with 101,621 in the Automotive division and 4,191 in the Sales Financing Division.

The Group has employees in 35 countries. The "10 major countries" (Argentina, Brazil, France, India, Morocco, Romania, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, and Turkey) account for 91.1% of the total number of employees.

b) Breakdown of recruitment EFPDle

The number of new hires has increased compared with 2021 at 13,716 people (9,421 in 2021 excluding Avtovaz Group and Russia). This level of recruitment has made it possible to adapt the Group to automotive market conditions. These recruitments made it possible to bolster the skills needed to develop the mobility solutions of the future and strengthen the capabilities of the Sales Financing Division to develop new services and adapt to changes in regulations.

B. Preparing the skills of today and tomorrow

Development of ReKnow University.

The automotive sector is changing, and skills in data analysis and handling, cyber security, electrification, maintenance and recycling of vehicles have become essential.

To support this transformation, we created ReKnow University in 2021.

This new company university supports the transformation of mobility professions by ensuring the link between initial training and lifelong learning and by bringing together various players (industrial, academic, institutional) to design and disseminate innovative training courses.

Structured around

five themes (electrical, circular data,

economy, software this

and cybersecurity), university trains for the mobility professions of the future. Dedicated initially to Group employees in France, it already trained more than 10,000 people since 2021. Our ambition is to train nearly 15,000 employees by 2025. The university’s activities are being gradually extended to industrial partners in the sector with whom we share the design and delivery of professional training courses.

For example, by actively participating in the creation of the E-Mobility Industry Academy in France, Renault Group is investing in the development of the skills of its industrial teams through the design of training modules that will enable it to train the people who will work on the electric motor production lines of tomorrow.

ReKnow University works

closely with renowned academic partners on the co-development of training courses for certification and diplomas to prepare for the future of mobility and our industry. A new campus for professions and qualifications, totally dedicated to the circular mobility industry, was inaugurated in 2022 at the Refactory site in Flins, which will enable its stakeholders and ReKnow University to develop the skills required to address the new challenges associated with the circular economy.

2.4.2.2.2. Ensuring the engagement and development of all talents

A. Supporting employees in their career and development

Supporting and developing employees is part of Renault Group’s DNA. To this end, the Group offers a variety of career and development opportunities for all so that everyone, depending on their wishes and the evolution of the company needs, can grow and develop through their experiences and their possibilities for exposure and/or education/training (70/20/10).

a) An annual exchange between employees and their manager: the Career and Development interview

Each year, all employees are encouraged to reflect on their career development wishes and their individual development plan, which they share with their manager as part of the Career and Development conversation. These items are formalized in the People@RenaultGroup tool.

Career development and individual development are also discussed by the HR function and managers, during HR committees and at least once a year in the People and Talent Review. The purpose of these committees is to strengthen the support

of employees in their development.

b) Internal mobility: a key lever for development

At Renault Group,

the diversity of experience considered a key lever for development, which is why the internal mobility policy aims to place employees at the wheel of their career and development and give them autonomy in management. of their mobility and their career at Renault.

is

Compliance with the key principles of this policy, such as a transparent internal job market, optimized job change times and management involved from the definition of the job to the selection of the final candidate, is the guarantee of mobility. agile, streamlined internal organization that embodies diversity and inclusion:

● search for diversity and complementarity of profiles and personalities within the teams and

the

In concrete terms, any employee with an internal mobility project who has held his or her position for at least two years can apply for a job offer published on the Group's internal career website

"JobOpportunities" of People@Renault Group (10,840 positions were published internally in 2022).

In France, in addition to mobility opportunities, the "Optimum" scheme offers short-term temporary assignments that allow employees to develop new skills and discover new areas of the company. It can also be an opportunity to test a new career direction before possibly proceeding with a mobility.

c) Grow@RenaultGroup to guide employees in their career and development

In 2022, Renault was launching a new digital platform “Grow@RenaultGroup” to guide employees in their career and development. In a single space, the employee can find advice, tools, resources to get to know themselves better, think about their future, build their development plan and thus prepare their exchange with their manager. This platform also offers activities and concrete ideas for developing through experience, through others or through access to more formal training (digital modules, articles, books).

d) Digital solutions to support employees in their careers and development: "People@RenaultGroup" and "Learning@Alliance"

Since 2019, the Group has deployed a digital solution called People@Renault (Workday) which offers feedback tools and functionalities to enhance its career, skills and formalize its professional aspirations.

Learning@Alliance is the Group's digital training platform that allows employees to develop thanks to the training modules and e-learning it provides.

B. Training to support skills development EFPD5

Renault Group supports the skills development of its employees to meet its sustainable growth and social responsibility targets. The priorities of the training teams for 2022 mainly focused on:

● Continuously adapting training courses to operational needs;

● Increasing the accessibility of our offered training and improving the learner experience;

● Developing new uses in training and continuing the digitalization of the offered training;

● Strengthening the Learning & Development community (composed of our functional academies, country and Corporate L&D teams).

224

a) Increasing access to training and improving the learner experience

Numerous training initiatives have been taken in the countries where the Group operates to develop skills and talents, in an uncertain economic and health context. The sustainable increase in the rate of access to training is one of the key indicators that is monitored monthly.

For example, DACIA in Romania has launched a major digital training program for industrial teams as part of an initiative supported by European funds.

In Brazil, the HR team deployed a remote induction program for newcomers to prepare for the integration of employees before their arrival in the Group (“pre- onboarding program”).

In addition, the commitment of the community of internal trainers and our function experts enabled us to deliver more than 941,000 hours of training to our teams, representing more than 51,6% of the training hours delivered in 2022 (and tracked in Learning@Alliance).

At the same time, Renault Group continued to develop its training management system (Learning@Alliance) by making it easier to understand the training offer through rapid access to targeted training on important themes issues (such as managing a team remotely and improving language skills) while allowing individualized paths with a choice of training subjects preferred by the employee in question.

Our function academies are strongly involved in the development of quality training content for the benefit of as many

people as possible. For example, the Manufacturing Academy has developed a new virtual reality training program for painters, “Eye Paint,” which has been deployed at the Group’s industrial sites in France.

b) Developing new uses in training and the learning experience

2022 was a year of diversity and inclusion. Renault Group specifically aims to support women at key points in their careers and to become the employer of choice for women in the automotive industry by 2025.

To support this ambition, a new training program (“W-journey”) was designed in collaboration by the Group’s Talent Management and Training teams with SKEMA Business School to help talented women take on greater responsibilities. This six-month online development program covers topics such as women’s leadership, understanding business issues and image and communication Group an management.

work on innovative project and collective mentoring round out this ambitious program. This program started in September 2021 has already trained 134 participants from 19 countries and all functions.

Digital training also continued to grow in 2022 thanks to the integration of new autonomous and distance training practices with a major campaign to promote distance language training and the creation of an end-of-year calendar to discover one’s learning style.

C. Preparing and developing our talent and leaders of tomorrow

a) an international approach to identifying, developing, and retaining talent To support the Renaulution strategic plan and in a highly competitive labor market, Renault Group is adapting its

Human

Resources policies key

to identify

talent,

accelerate their development and preparation, and retain them for the Group. The Group has an approach, “Talent Accelerator,” deployed in all its countries to:

● take more risk to reveal more talent earlier with a greater variety of profiles in line with the Group’s strategic challenges;

● involve and empower managers in identifying and developing talent;

● better address new business needs.

In 2022, more than 5,000 talents identified worldwide, for whom development actions were defined.

To support the development of these talents, in addition to the levers and tools available to all, these employees

can benefit from complementary actions locally or

globally:

● tools to have a better knowledge of oneself, become aware of one’s strengths and boost one’s development and impact in the Group;

● participation in cross-functional actions;

● mentoring;

● coaching;

● training in leadership, communication;

● international transfers.

b) A commitment to the advancement of women at all levels of the organization

The Group aims to be an employer of choice for women. To achieve this, Renault has undertaken actions which have made it possible to:

● increase the presence of women in the Group's highest management bodies (BoM, CMC, BMC). This share fell from 22.1% at the end of December 2021 to 28.8% at the end of 2022 thanks to the management of internal appointments and a proactive policy of recruiting women (at least 1 out of 2 recruitments in 2022 of senior executives was a female). The objective is to reach 30% by the end of 2025 and 40% by the end of 2028;

● recruit more women in the Group: overall the Group aims to have 50% of women among all of its recruitments. At least one female candidate must be proposed for any position open to external recruitment;

● reveal more female talent through the new internal identification

talent approach. The

proportion women among the talents identified by the Group, who will be supported and developed to enable them to positions of

of

access in the Group, increased from 26% in 2019 to 32% in 2022;

responsibility

● support the development of female talents:

- the Group offers at Corporate level but also at local country level, courses dedicated to women to support their development. At Corporate level, 2 flagship programs are offered each year, made of a mix of

up

face-to-face sessions, intersessional work,

personal development modules, workshops and mentoring;

- W-Journey: is a program, organized with the collaboration of SKEMA Business School, which supports our female talents over 6 months for a transition from manager to leader. 134 talented women have benefited from this program since it was set up in 2021. In 2022, this program received the Excellence

D. Assess individual performance a) From the focus on results to the inclusion of behaviors

The Renaulution strategy aims to transform the Group to become a technology and services company, which means transforming the managerial culture and

strengthening the collective and collaboration.

Thus, professional behaviors become as important as the results obtained because they are key to working better together and improving the

and strengthening sustainable performance of the company.

The performance appraisal was reviewed in 2021. It is based on three principles: collegiality, shared criteria, and dialogue and feedback throughout the year.

b) Individual contribution: a combination of WHAT and HOW

For Renault, performance and individual contribution result from the combination of the following two criteria:

● the WHAT or the individual objectives, i.e. the evaluation of the achievement of the objectives set in the year;

● the HOW or Professional Behaviors, i.e. the evaluation of how the results were obtained.

WHAT Objectives

Carried out carried out

Performance evaluation is conducted by the manager. It is systematically enriched by a collegial assessment, to guarantee greater consistency and fairness within the company during the annual “People Review.” It is also fed by the self-assessment that the employee had the opportunity to share before the People Reviews.

In addition, the assessment is based on the exchange and dialogue between manager and employee, during annual interviews on the one hand, but also through regular feedback throughout the year. The annual performance and development review is the opportunity to look at the results of the past year and discuss the employee’s contribution to the team’s performance. Regular feedback will allow the manager and the employees to discuss the and

progress of the objectives the professional behaviors observed.

Beyond expected achievement

If results fall short of expectations, an improvement plan is implemented by the manager and employee to restore a dynamic to individual performance.

c) Feedback as a development tool

Renault wishes to encourage the culture of feedback as a

key

practice individual development

for

and

the improvement of community performance.

Gathering feedback from peers, functional managers and/or team members allows for better visibility into what is going well and what can be improved. Feedback is a useful tool for any employee in his personal development as well as managerial support to stimulate teams and cross-collaboration.

To facilitate the request and collection of feedback,

Renault uses

the

functionalities

of

the

People@RenaultGroup tool.

2.4.2.2.3. A competitive pay policy

A. Recognizing individual contribution and engagement EFPD1g

The compensation of “white-collar” employees is based on:

● the level of responsibility. Positions are assessed according to their level of responsibility based on a work analysis method. This method has the advantage of allowing Renault to compare its employee pay with the market to better manage competitiveness and the attractiveness of the compensation policy. The aim is to be able to recruit key skills and pay Renault employees atthe right level;

●

the level to the company, assessed through the degree of achievement of the objectives set and the behaviors implemented to achieve these objectives;

of individual contribution made

The variable portion of the compensation, intended for managers and executives, is built around a single scheme recognizing the performance of the employee, their area of activity, and the Group in a spirit of solidarity;

Numerical indicators are used to reflect the levels of achievement set atthe collective level.

For 2022, the Group implemented pay increase budgets reflecting some wage moderation in several countries.

However, specific budgets are systematically maintained to reduce the gender pay gap in the countries concerned. The compensation of senior executives is discussed in chapter 3.2.

B. Sharing collective results and contributing to Renault’s development

EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDING

In 2022, Renault launched Renaulution Shareplan, a large- scale employee shareholding operation. The aim was to involve all employees in the Renaulution strategy and the future performance of the Group.

By making its Revolution and projecting itself into the future, Renault is not forgetting its roots: on the contrary, it is continuing the social laboratory tradition that has made it a unique company but bringing this tradition up to date.

This unprecedented operation offered each eligible Group employee:

● the allocation of 6 bonus Renault shares (offer rolled out in 29 countries), and

● possibility of acquiring shares

the Renault on preferential terms (offer rolled out in 21 countries).

Under the subscription offer, eligible employees had the opportunity to subscribe for shares at a 30% discount from the average of the 20 closing stock market prices preceding the date on which the Chief Executive Officer set the subscription price. The subscription price was €22.02. In addition to this 30% discount, Renault Group added an additional 300% contribution, capped at 6 bonus shares.

Renaulution Shareplan 2022 was a great success with the Group's employees: 95,396 employees benefited from the allocation of 6 bonus shares, and 40,307 subscriptions

were recorded, i.e. a subscription rate of over 36% at Group level.

The details of Renaulution Shareplan are discussed in chapter 3.2.5.3.

INCENTIVE POLICY

In addition, for employees in France in particular, Renault applies an incentive policy that includes the redistribution of Renault Group profits as well as bonus payments for contributions to site performance.

The agreement of April 14, 2022, signed for 2022 and paid to employees in March 2023, includes, as for previous agreements, two components:

● profit-sharing linked to the Group’s operating margin results;

● profit-sharing scheme based on the performance of each establishment.

Over the past and performance-related bonuses at Renault s.a.s. totaled the following amounts:

three years, profit-sharing

Year (€ million) Aggregate amount: financial incentive + performance-related bonuses

2020 121.5 2021 122.4

2022 149.9

C. Control of personnel costs

The Group’s personnel costs totaled €5,661m in 2022, of which €5,313m was for the Automotive Division. They are up by 3% compared with 2021. This variation is explained by the Group's actions to adapt to the crisis in the automotive markets, the control of our salary policy and the implementation of an employee shareholding plan. The "10 largest countries" (Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Spain, France, India, Morocco, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey) represent 87% of the Group's personnel costs.

2.4.2.2.4. A stimulating work environment that promotes diversity

A. A flexible organization of work EFPD2a

Beginning in 2021, Renault Group voluntarily deployed a hybrid work organization that is both flexible and innovative and now concerns most of the white-collar workers. As such, employees around the world are offered the possibility of adopting an arrangement combining a minimum of 2 days per week of remote work and a minimum of 20 % of working time on site. The principles of hybrid work were materialized by the unanimous signing on April 26, 2021, of an addendum to the Global Framework Agreement ofJuly 9, 2019.

This agreement is gradually being rolled out worldwide. It provides the general framework and allows for local adaptations to take into account specific aspects related to the activity or culture of the country.

The first step in implementing the principles of the 2021 agreement is to determine eligibility for hybrid work on the basis of objective criteria. Participation in the new hybrid organization is voluntary. For eligible employee categories, the principle is a minimum of two days of teleworking per week and a minimum of in-person work of 20% of monthly working time to maintain and develop the social connection with both the team members and the rest ofthe company.

On this flexible, simple basis, a very rich social dialog has taken place all over the world and has led to local agreements (e.g. in France, Romania, and Germany) or the publication of new human resources policies (e.g. in India, the United Kingdom, and Brazil).

In 2022, nearly 67 % of eligible employees, or more than 26,000 worldwide, voluntarily adopted

a hybrid organization of work. This profound change in the organization of work has been accompanied by equally important changes in the way people work.

Renault Group also welcomes the fact that meetings have become more efficient and that time is freed up for oneself and for more concentrated work. Finally, there are positive side effects of the hybrid mode on inclusion, particularly for international teams who have learned to work bettertogether in hybrid mode.

Renault Group’s pragmatic approach to hybrid work organization, based on trust and accountability, has become an important element of attractiveness in its employer promise around the world.

In parallel with the roll-out of hybrid working, the Group has put in place a strategy to deploy new Renault workspaces. The aim is to create a unique workspace experience within the Group across all of its tertiary sites.

This experience is based on 5 pillars:

● a corporate strategy

serving transformation for the Group;

as

lever a

of

● collective intelligence to strengthen synergies;

● continuous improvement

to increase operational excellence;

● financial performance to optimize our resources;

● business experience to develop our attractiveness and support innovation.

These new working environments are intended to be deployed progressively as real estate opportunities arise and are currently deployed in 20% of the target scope.

The implementation of the agreement in France has resulted in joint discussions with the social partners (3 meetings) and negotiations, which led to the signing of an agreement on new working methods on June 10, 2021. This agreement sets out the main principles of the global addendum mentioned above. It defines a standard hybrid organization of work formula with two to three days of telework per

week. Furthermore, it establishes the principle of the evolution of tertiary sites by gradually putting in place new dynamic workspaces.

Implemented in 2021, the new organization of work will be evaluated both in terms of employee satisfaction and in terms of improved team efficiency. It also opens up opportunities in terms of the real estate footprint and the possibility of redesigning less busy workplaces to make them even more dynamic and collaborative.

Renault Group complies with the legal obligations and collective agreements in terms of working hours of the countries where it has operations.

To preserve jobs and adapt to fluctuations in automotive markets, Renault has instituted a system of flexible work time. It aims to find the best possible balance between the

Company’s interests and quality of life in the workplace for the employees in question, through consultations with employee representatives and labor unions.

The measures focus in particular on the conditions for reorganizing work time, such as by adding mandatory shifts to meet heavy demand or reducing work time when demand falls, notably by using individual or collective rest days.

At sites in France, for example, the average working week is 35 hours. In the factories, the principle is two alternating eight-hour shifts with, in the event of spiking demand, the possibility to add a fixed night shift team.

B. A company that promotes diversity and inclusion

a) An approach that fosters community spirit The Group’s diversity and inclusion policy is designed to enable all its employees, regardless of their differences or specific characteristics, to interact and work under the best possible conditions. On July 2, 2013, Renault Group

signed a Global Framework Agreement, “Committing together for sustainable growth and development,” demonstrating its commitment to promoting all forms of diversity and eliminating discrimination. On July 9, 2019, an additional agreement was signed: “Working together to build a Renault Group working environment” (see chapter 2.4.2.2.6).

Renault Group’s Diversity and Inclusion policy is now steered by a newly created department, the Diversity & Inclusion Department, which reports directly to the Group’s Director, Human Resources. It works closely with all the countries, functions, and entities of the Group to steer the diversity and inclusion roadmap and ensure its proper implementation.

b) Gender diversity within the Company EFPD6a

The proportion of women in the Group’s total workforce is 20.8% as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 0.5% compared with 2021 (2018 to 2021 are restated, excluding Russia and the Avtovaz Group).

Financial statements

The breakdown between women and men is calculated on the basis ofthe global scope as of December 31, 2022.

Renault Group’s ambition is to be the best employer for women in the automotive industry.

with the objectives of:

● neutralizing the gender pay gap by 2025;

● increasing the presence of women.

In this respect, the Group’s ambition is to have 30% women in management positions by 2030, 35% by 2035, and 50% by 2050 (top 11,000, i.e. 10% of the Group’s positions with the highest level of responsibility, excluding RRG). We rely on several levers, in particular external recruitment and internal

mobility and promotion. All specific HR processes are adapted to help us achieve our objectives, and each country, function and entity has clear objectives, for example, regarding the recruitment of women or the percentage of women among trainees and apprentices.

In December 2022, we had 25.5% women in management positions.

In order to ensure, or even accelerate, their ability to move into these positions, all HR processes aim to ensure they are identified and trained. On this point, the Group offers women a range of tools to assist with their development (mentoring, coaching and specific training schemes), enabling them to fulfill their potential and demonstrate theirleadership.

The Group thus offers various development programs dedicated to women (see 2.4.2.2.2.C.b).

c) Anti-discrimination EFPD6c

The Group has a proactive anti-discrimination policy: zero-discrimination policy, review of whistleblowing and investigation procedures, common system for monitoring whistleblowing reports, global

internal anti-sexism campaign, awareness-raising and engagement mechanism at each site, and implementation of zero- discrimination advisers at each site.

In addition,

Renault external

commitments:

Group has signed

● the #StOpE (Stop Ordinary Sexism in the Workplace) Charterin 2020;

● the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles in 2022;

● UN Free & Equal standards against discrimination of LGBT+ people (2020) and, in France, the Charte de l’Autre Cercle (2020) for the inclusion of LGBT+ people in the workplace (2020);

● in France, the #ManifestInclusion Charter to promote the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in economic life (2021);

● in France, the Charte des 50+ for the promotion of employees over 50 (2022);

● the International Labour Organization’s Business and Disability Charter (2022).

The breakdown by age group is calculated on the global scope as of December 31, 2022.

Renault seeks to develop its employees at all ages, notably helping young people enter the world of work through numerous initiatives (see chapter 2.4.3), while at the same time drawing on the experience of seniors.

e) Integration of individuals with disabilities into the workforce EFPD6d

The Company

has embarked

on worldwide coordination of

the

its disability policy, creating a link between all country initiatives. The purpose of this is to encourage the professional integration of individuals with disabilities, to improve their employability (recruitment and retention), challenge preconceptions of disability, ensure greater accessibility, and provide training to raise awareness among employees and managers.

The employment rate for individuals with disabilities was 3.01% in 2022, stable compared with 3.10% in 2021 (the 2021 figure is restated and excludes Russia and the Avtovaz Group).

2.4.2.2.5. Promote the practice of physical and sports activities

Renault Group affirms its commitment to sporting values and associates itself with national and international sporting events. Some examples in 2022: Mobilize, the Renault Group brand dedicated to new forms of mobility, becomes a partner of women's rugby and the main partner of the women's XV de France. On April 28, 2022, Renault becomes a Premium Partner of Roland-Garros for an initial period of 5 years (2022 to 2026 editions).

For

Renault Group employees,

the CSEs

of the

establishments offer a wide range of activities, in particular through Renault Sports Agreements, or provide employees with a financial contribution on their annual subscriptions. Sports halls and changing rooms also allow the practice of activities in the workplace, as in the Paris region on the sites of Lardy, Aubevoye, Villiers-Saint- Frédéric, Guyancourt (Technocentre) or Boulogne, but also in the industrial sites, in France and abroad.

Finally, by launching sporting challenges (Call & Care challenge), by participating via the Entente Sportive in solidarity events such as the Course du cœur, or by sponsoring the company's participants during local foot races or races by bike, Renault is committed to supporting its employees in practicing physical activity.

2.4.2.2.6. Social dialog

● Year after

year,

Renault Group confirms

its determination to use social dialog to build a world of work in a constantly shifting environment, be it at the global or local level.

● This determination is reflected in particular in the signature of Global Framework Agreements that make it possible to reconcile the interests of both the Group and its employees.

● The Group’s Framework Agreement “Committing together for sustainable growth and development” dates back to July 2, 2013. This agreement between the Management of Renault Group, the members of the Group Works Council and IndustriALL Global sets out the

first Global

Union societal social, and environmental responsibility of the The

Group. signatories have committed themselves to five major lines of action:

● respectfor employees’ fundamental rights;

● socialresponsibility toward employees;

● corporate social responsibility in the areas where Renault Group operates;

● purchasing and relationships with suppliers and subcontractors;

● preservation of the planet through the reduction of the environmental footprint.

● The Group’s second Global Framework Agreement, “Working together to build a Renault Group working environment,” was entered into on July 9, 2019, between Renault Group’s Management, IndustriALL Global Union, the French trade union federations and the other trade union federations or unions represented on the Group Works Council. This agreement, of which the Group Works Council is a stakeholder, and which in October 2019 received the first prize for the most innovative collective agreement awarded by the Assises du Droit Social (ADS), aims to better prepare for and cope with permanent changes in the automotive industry that have a major impact on the labor market, based on five levers:

● an interaction on the changing working environment;

● a collaborative management system;

● a lasting commitment to inclusion;

● a work/life balance;

● adaptation of the working environment.

●

An addendum

to

this

2019 Global Framework

Agreement specifying the conditions for teleworking for Renault Group employees was signed on April 26, 2021, by Mr. de Meo for Renault Group, the Global Group Works Council and IndustriALL Global Union to provide a framework for the transformation of working methods

worldwide. It also responds to the expectations expressed by employees, reinforced since the health crisis, on the possibility of mixing face-to-face and teleworking to improve the balance between private and professional life. This new hybrid organization of work at Renault Group aims to get the best out of face- to-face and teleworking activities and operates on a voluntary basis. It is based on the following principles:

● more flexibility in personal organization of work: organization of the week between telework and face- to-face work around a minimum of two days of telework per week and maintaining at least 20% of monthly work time in face-to-face work;

● empowerment and autonomy: based on individual objectives, free organization of work between

individual, collaborative and face-to-face meetings with the team;

● respect for work/life

balance: respect for the company’s working hours as well as for break and holiday times (right to disconnect).

These two Global Framework Agreements and the addendum constitute structuring social dialog themes.

A. The Worldwide Group Works Council, a forum for responsible social dialog EFPD4a

The Worldwide Group Works Council has 40 members:

● European Economic Area: 31 members;

● other countries: 9 members.

It is the essential

forum

for social dialog at the international level: its members regularly discuss major changes in the Group and its strategic priorities with the Group’s top management and operational departments. exceptional

When an

proposed

decision has

transnational consequences likely to significantly affect the interests of employees, the Group Works Council meets as a European Works Council.

2022 was marked by an unfavorable environment due to the various crises faced (COVID-19 pandemic, shortage of semi-conductors, rising raw materials costs, energy crisis, Ukraine-Russia conflict, inflation, etc.).

In this context, maintaining ongoing social dialog was essential to provide employees with appropriate support. The Group Works Council met 45 times in 2022: 8 internal meetings, 21 meetings of the Select Group Works Council, 5 extraordinary information and consultation sessions, in European formation, concerning the project to outsource certain activities as part of the global project to transform the Human Resources function, the project to change the RRG scope in Europe in 2022 and 2023, the project to sell RRG Belgium and RRG Luxembourg, the project to create a

leading electric vehicle entity (Ampere project), and the project to create an entity dedicated to thermal and hybrid powertrain (Horse project), as well as 8 meetings to monitorthe Global Framework Agreements. Given the circumstances, the plenary session of the Group Works Council was held for the second time remotely with all members from 19 different countries on September 29 and 30 and October 4, 2022.

Mr. de Meo gave an introduction on the Group’s situation and strategic priorities with significant time for questions and answers. The agenda was established in line with the Group’s current organization around the Brands (Renault, Mobilize, Dacia) and functions (engineering, industry, human resources, and P&L statement). The plenary session was

also supplemented by 3 presentations related to

the monitoring of the Global Framework Agreements on Ethics and Compliance, Health, Safety, Environment and Ergonomics, and Diversity and Inclusion.

“In 2022, the Renault Global Group Works Council made a significant contribution to the transformation of Renault Group. In addition to the 2022 plenary session, the Renault Group Works Council was asked for information and consultation on 5 occasions by the company on the transformation of the Human Resources function, the change in the European scope of Retail Renault Group, the sale of the Belgium and Luxembourg branches, the creation of the Horse entity and the creation of the Ampere entity.

The Renault Group Works Council was able to review the implementation of the 2013 global framework agreement 3 times in 2022 and the 2019 Global Framework Agreement 5 times.

The Renault Group Works Council was regularly informed of the situation in Ukraine and immediately informed of the end of Renault’s activities in Russia.

The Group Works Council was regularly informed of the progress of the Horse and Ampere projects through no fewer than 7 meetings between February and November 2022.

The Group Works Council was involved in the deployment of the Renault Group Vigilance Plan through

B. Long-term convergence between Group performance and employee quality of life in the workplace

02

Renault Group endeavors to offer all its employees an environment and working relationships that are favorable to their individual development and improve their quality of life at work.

Working environments are gradually becoming more flexible and, by improving quality of life, enhance the performance of the Company.

Employee feedback is one of the key elements in identifying the focus for improving the quality of life at work. In 2022, Renault Group adopted a new digital tool to collect employee feedback in a faster and more comprehensive way. With simple interfaces, the platform makes it easy for employees to participate in surveys while protecting

the confidentiality of responses. Advanced functionalities on the analysis of quantitative and qualitative results allow managers and the HR teams to quickly focus on the issues that need attention, track results, and cross-reference data between the various surveys via the same system. In June and July 2022, a global survey on diversity and inclusion was launched via this new platform. The psychological health survey and the Group employee survey are also planned to be deployed with the help of the tool.

The prevention of psychosocial risks and the promotion of psychological health remain a priority for Renault Group. To provide the best possible support to employees in the context of the health crisis, a support system has been put in place. In France, this relies on occupational health services, facilitators and coaches within the company, and aims to help employees and managers live and organize work as efficiently as possible in this new context.

At the end of 2021, a health survey was sent to all employees. It was constructed based on the COPSOQ (Copenhagen

Psychosocial Questionnaire), aimed to identify risk and protection factors within the company. The analysis of the results led to the implementation of appropriate action plans within the various business lines. In addition, the skills transformation agreement, CAR 22, which includes a psychosocial risk support and prevention mechanism, has enabled the deployment of tools in this area, aimed at developing primary, secondary and tertiary risk prevention. In the area of primary prevention, extensive communication has been deployed as well as e-learning training for everyone on awareness of psychosocial risks. With regard to secondary prevention, several training sessions were held for all stakeholders, employees, managers and staff representatives. Lastly, to strengthen tertiary prevention, the support measures were enhanced through an increased use of psychologists as well as the reaffirmed role of our internal facilitators. To measure the effect of all these actions, a flash barometer, partly based

on the health survey questionnaire (12 questions), was conducted on the scope of the agreement (3 Flash Barometers over 2022).

C. Ongoing local social dialog EFPD4b EFPD4c

The social dialog at Renault in France in 2022 was structured around three main topics:

● deployment of the Renouveau France 2025 agreement signed on December 14, 2021;

● consideration the

of new metallurgy collective bargaining agreement;

● preparation and

anticipation Group’s organizational changes, in particular with the creation oftwo separate entities: Horse and Ampere.

of

the

These last two issues led to a discussion to define the content, scope and timing of a common social foundation for all Group entities in France.

Signing and deployment of the Renouveau France 2025 agreement

After several months of negotiations, the representative trade unions CFE-CGC, CFDT and FO (75.8% trade union representation) and the Management signed a three-year social agreement entitled Re-Nouveau France 2025 on December 14. The social partners hailed the ambition of the text and the associated measures, which will make it possible to guide the employment and skills of employees towards value-creating activities of the future while supporting Renault Group’s activity and sustainable performance in France.

The Re-Nouveau France 2025 agreement places France at the heart of the Group’s industrial and research and development activities by situating future value-creating technologies in France. Renault Group confirms its commitment to allocate the manufacture of 9 new models to French factories and will make France the center of its engineering for decarbonized, connected, intelligent vehicle technologies.

To meet the mobility requirements of tomorrow, the roup must acquire new expertise. It is therefore committed to recruiting 2,500 new employees as well as providing 10,000 training and retraining courses across all the business lines, in particular via Re-Know University. The company will also continue to adapt its workforce and will proceed with 1,700 departures in engineering and support functions by the end of the agreement. To adapt skills dynamically over the duration of the agreement, the company is implementing an Employment and Career Management system (GEPP), which will be reviewed each year.

A 1st assessment of this agreement was carried out in October 2022 and showed that all the commitments made, particularly in terms of employment and activity allocation, were being met.

Implementation of the common socialfoundation 2 major events occurred in 2022:

First, the Group announced that it was considering the creation of two separate entities: one dedicated to electric vehicles and software based in France (Ampere) and the other to combustion and hybrid engines (Horse).

At the same time, after six years of negotiations, the professional sector of almost all the Group’s French

234

entities, metallurgy, entered into an agreement that shook up the social standard applied in the company.

This new national metallurgy collective bargaining agreement (CCN) was signed on February 7, 2022, by CFDT, CFE-CGC, FO, and UIMM.

It comes into force on January 1, 2024, except for the social protection theme, which comes into force on January 1, 2023.

The changes that we need to make and that are the most formative for our organization are those relating to classification.

During this transitional period, the companies must deploy the new classification system.

In the framework of the Re-Nouveau agreement, entered into on December 14, 2021, it was agreed to initiate joint discussions on the calendar and arrangements for implementing the new classification. These exchanges were also an opportunity to define the involvement and contribution of the central and local OSRs at key stages of the project.

Several consultation meetings in April 2022 made it possible to share with the trade unions the methodology that would be used for job scoring. This methodology, which allowed for the involvement of all the players in the business lines, HR, and the trade unions, was welcomed by all.

The changes in the Group’s organization, coupled with the implementation of the new collective agreement, led to the signing of a method agreement providing the structure for the themes and scope of the future common social foundation on July 27, 2022.

In this context, the process of informing and consulting the bodies took place throughout the year with regular updates on the reorganization project status. Six ESCC meetings were held between February and November 2022 to inform the elected representatives on this project. A key step in the process will be the consultation of the central body on this issue on December 2.

Three major negotiations were also held in the context of the implementation ofthis common social foundation

● To cope with the historical context in terms of inflation, the signing of a Purchasing Power Agreement on October 11, 2022;

● The implementation of

a complementary

health insurance agreement, allowing all French entities to benefit from the same health cover. This agreement, signed by all the trade unions, will come into force on January 1, 2023;

● The proposal for a common pension scheme, with negotiations to be completed by December 2023.

Internationally, exchanges with local social partners were intensified, particularly in connection with the Horse and Ampere projects and on purchasing power due to inflation. Several countries (France, Romania, Spain, etc.) have entered into agreements with specific measures on this subject.

2.4.3.1. Contributing to the development and vitality ofthe territories EFPD14c

Renault Group is a major player in the economic and social development of the territories in which it works. Present in 38 countries, the Company considers that it has a responsibility to make sure that its impact on the regions where it is located is positive and to contribute to their sustainable development. The Group’s ambition is to create shared value for the mutual benefit of the Company and all of its stakeholders. It therefore takes care to identify the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders that surround it (see 2.1.4) and to respond to them as far as possible through its core business and setting up innovative solutions.

2.4.3.2. An active participant through its core business

activities EFPD14b

It is difficult to truly isolate the Company’s contributions within a complex and interdependent socioeconomic fabric. Beyond direct employment generated and the taxes paid by the Company, the other direct and indirect contributions and benefits are shared

among the

members of a network.

According to the figures published by the ACEA, the association of European automotive manufacturers,

13.0 million people (representing 7.0% of the active population) work in the European automotive sector (direct and indirect jobs – 2020 figures).

The number of direct jobs totaled 2.5 million (2020 figures). This includes automotive manufacturing, equipment and accessories, and coachbuilders. Indirect employment includes other manufacturing fields, vehicle sales, parts and accessories, maintenance, and

fuel, leasing transportation, as well construction and

as road maintenance and associated activities.

The Humanitarian and Social

Aid

Fund (FASH) was created by Renault Retail Group in 2003: it arose from a collective agreement signed with the representative labor unions within RRG.

The purpose of this fund is to grant financial aid to the employees of RRG and also to humanitarian action associations.

The FASH continues to provide help and support for education, health, emergency food aid, aid to regain mobility, disability and the environment.

2.4.3.3. Societal actions supported by a global network

The Sustainable Development Department leads, coordinates and relies on a network of ESG correspondents in the main countries where the Group operates as well as on a newly created dedicated committee.

Since July 2022, the country correspondents have met every two months to share local initiatives and maximize their contributions to the

Group's sustainable development strategy.

The Group Sustainable Development Committee consists of representatives from each of the corporate functions and each of the Renault Group brands. Meeting on a monthly basis, this group of Sustainable Development correspondents aims to monitor and deploy the Group’s environmental, social, societal and governance commitments.

2.4.3.6. Supporting access to education throughout the world EFPD14d

02

Renault Group carries out numerous actions intended to promote inclusion, access to education and the fight against dropping out of school:

Renault ElectriCity is planning to recruit 700 permanent employees by the end of 2024, as part of a joint initiative with local employment agencies, the Pôle Emploi and all local stakeholders.

Factory visits are also organized with the national education system to develop school/company relations. In 2022, the three Hauts-de-France sites hosted more than 300 students of all profiles (secondary school students, general and vocational high school students, engineering students, etc.). Unprecedented visits to the Maubeuge and Douai factories organized for the families of employees by small electric train were opened to local secondary school students. The Douai director sponsored the INSA Hauts de France (engineering school) class of 2021.

With CORIF (an association with strong roots in the north of France that has been working for 40 years to promote professional equality and gender diversity and to combat stereotypes and sexist representations), ElectriCity is increasing the number of actions and visits to its sites for the benefit of women seeking employment. For the second consecutive year, ElectriCity continues to invest in DuoDay to raise awareness among managers and all employees of the diversity of disability situations at work, but also to give individuals with the

disabilities opportunity to discover the industry’s professions and enjoy a new experience. This year, six duos were trained in our factories.

Together with the UIMM de Sambre-Avesnois (Union des Industries et des Métiers de la Métallurgie), ElectriCity is a partner of the EDIVAL association, which aims to bring industry and the educational world closer together through personalized educational visits to industrial companies. In this context, the ElectriCity communication team has worked with teachers to develop educational materials for classroom visits (comics, safety animation, and presentation of professions). ElectriCity also supports the Emergence program, the objective of which is to enable talented young people from modest backgrounds to pursue the studies they want (which are often long, selective and/or expensive) and to build a professional future that matches their potential and ambition: at this stage, two pairs (therefore two young people) are being sponsored for €4,000 over five years. Thanks to the participation and involvement of more than a hundred employees in the “Call & Care” sports and solidarity challenge in June 2022, ElectriCity is supporting the Article 1 association (€5,000 donation), which aims to prevent individuals aged 16 to 25 from working-class backgrounds in the Nord department from dropping out of school through guidance, success in higher education, and development of career paths for better professional integration.

Renault ElectriCity is a member of the Fondation du Nord, which supports innovative initiatives for inclusion through employment, support for the most vulnerable people, in particular young people, and the independence of the elderly and individuals with disabilities.

The Le Mans factory also organized 14 visits with schools, and 273 pupils visited the Cléon factory.

Alpine launched the first edition of the Alpine Mechanical Excellence Competition. This competition gives students (high school students, apprentices, higher technician students or professional qualifications, etc.) in the vehicle mechanics engineering section from all over France the opportunity to showcase their skills and know-how and to promote the vehicle mechanics engineering sector by positioning it as a sector of excellence open to all. With 1,111 entries in the first edition, the competition highlighted the interest of young mechanics in participating in such an event. In addition to the experience gained through the trials and the opportunity to work in unique situations and on unique mechanical parts, the moments of exchange with the team’s motorists during the regional trials or the finals allowed the candidates to perfect their know-how but also open up their personal and professional outlooks.

For its part, Renault Argentina supported the “Neighbors Barrio Reno” community program in 2022 to help 98 beneficiaries from an underprivileged neighborhood near the factory. The aim is to allow these individuals develop their own businesses. Partnerships with local authorities and NGOs such as “Las Omas” and “Innovar Sustentabilidad” are in place to train people in sewing, cooking and carpentry.

Future Generation is another important vocational training program targeting young people in socially vulnerable situations in Brazil. This free six-month training course, intended for young people aged 15 to 24 who are still enrolled in secondary school or who have completed their schooling, is designed to prepare them for entry into the labor market. It includes courses in computer science, management, citizenship, behavior and civics. This year, 80 young people finished the program.

Renault Foundation Morocco contributes to improving school conditions in the regions where the Group operates. It encourages the schooling of children, in particular girls, and is fighting to reduce school drop-out rates in rural areas through the supply of school buses. In 2022, 2,100 pupils benefited from the school transport service every day.

The Foundation is renovating a school in a rural area. This year,the school is located in the Tangierregion.

Since its launch in 2019, the BIBLIOBUS initiative has established itself in the rural and suburban school

238 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

environment of the regions of Tangier and Casablanca as an essential educational event to support reading and cultural learning. The project was also selected as a benchmark by the Moroccan

national education authorities for its high-impact pedagogical approach with a view to deploying similar initiatives in other regions of the Kingdom.

In partnership with the organization “AlJisr,” 30 young people over 18 are now being supported in the framework of a program for IT training and integration into employment in companies.

The Renault Foundation Morocco is also very involved in the prevention of road risks. With the Tkayes school initiative, more than 10,000 children and their families benefited from the road safety education program in 2022.

The Renault Foundation Romania offered 15 “Constantin Stroe” scholarships for the 2022 school year. Through the NGO “Salvati 102

Copiii,” it helped children from disadvantaged backgrounds to continue their education.

The Foundation launched the website kilometrulbine.ro containing environmental education material, developed in partnership with the NGO Viitor plus.

Training and skills management are the essential drivers for supporting the Group in achieving its objectives. The Company has two main objectives: on the one hand, to adapt its skills to develop its competitive advantage and still better serve its customers, and on the other, to promote development through training in new technologies, notably digital.

Finally, to support the transformation of the automotive sector, in 2021 we created the ReKnow University. This new company university supports the transformation of mobility professions by ensuring the link between initial training and lifelong learning and by bringing together various players (industrial, academic, institutional) to design and disseminate innovative training courses. (see 2.4.2.2.1.B).

2.4.3.7. Plants in transition

With 34 plants worldwide, Renault Group has an industrial system resolutely focused on the future, ready to meet the new challenges of the automotive sector and to customer expectations. New occupations, new know-how, new tools… the industrial metaverse is a

the driver for connected, agile and competitive factory, which places humans, i.e. all company employees, at the heart of the system. Our aim is to ensure the satisfaction of our customers

by manufacturing and delivering quality vehicles within the announced time frames.

Women and men at the heart ofthe transformation

The Industry teams include nearly 65,000 employees worldwide. More agile, more reactive and trained in new technologies, employees focus on the highest-value- added interventions

and take advantage of these innovations to be relieved of certain operations. They are performing fewer and fewer arduous tasks.

The automotive sector is undergoing rapid change with the ramp-up

of electrified vehicles, customization, increasingly connected vehicles, etc. To meet this revolution, the automotive industry must adapt to ensure the reliability and full traceability of its production to ensure its competitiveness.

Renault Group chose to digitalize its industrial system to support all employees, manufacture connected, customized vehicles and reinforce the customer’s place in the plant. Through this approach, the Company has two aims: guarantee vehicle quality and the competitiveness ofits factories.

In October 2022, Renault Group took a new step in its digital transformation the first ever

by launching industrial Metaverse. It is built around four dimensions: bulk data collection, digital process twins, connecting the supply chain ecosystem, and a of

set advanced technologies. By 2025, the deliver Metaverse will €320 million in savings, plus €260 million in inventory savings, a 60% reduction in vehicle delivery time, a 50 % reduction in the carbon of vehicle footprint

manufacturing, and a contribution to the Group’s target of 60% reduction in warranty costs.

The supervision offered by the Metaverse through better visibility of the working environment allows the players to gain agility and autonomy

in decision-making. Technologies from the gaming world are making user experiences more immersive. This is the case for virtual- reality painting training. AI

(Artificial Intelligence) algorithms facilitate employees’ ability to anticipate, such as optimization and flow management functionalities for supply chain experts.

Transforming creation

our ecosystem

to generate value

Several major strategic projects are at the heart of industrial Renaulution:

Refactory: an unprecedented activity in industry

In the the Group announced transformation of its site in Flins to create the Refactory, Europe’s first circular economy factory dedicated to mobility, with the target of a negative CO2 balance by 2030. Since then, this transformation plan has been gradually rolled out and will continue until 2024. The site is organized around four areas of activity, each with its own specialty: ReTrofit, ReCycle and

November 2020,

ReEnergy, ReStart (see details in 2.3.2.2 “Resources and circular economy”).

The Flins Refactory enables Renault Group to benefit from a rapidly growing source of value while reaffirming its industrial footprint in France. Its aim is to encourage initiatives, develop innovation for the circular economy

activities of Choisy-le-Roi. Support and training measures for employees at Flins and Choisy-Le- Roi were put in place.

Refactory is at the heart of the Group’s sustainable development. This activity is intended to be deployed more widely, as with the Seville factory in Spain, which was inaugurated on December 2, 2022.

Renault ElectriCity, the industrial hub and leader in northern France

This major industrial project, Renault ElectriCity, not only aims to produce 480,000 electric vehicles per year by 2025, but also to bring together a complete ecosystem of suppliers and enable Renault Group and its brands to innovate and reduce many costs

for greater competitiveness.

Accelerate the decarbonization plan for its industrial sites

As part of its Renaulution strategy, Renault Group announced on November 24, 2022, an acceleration of the decarbonization plan for its industrial sites with three strategic and unprecedented partnerships to achieve its transition

energy objectives. This stage

new was materialized with Voltalia for the largest green electricity supply contract in France, for the Group’s French factories: in

Douai, with

ENGIE for the first deep geothermal energy project at a European industrial site, and with Dalkia and EDF Group for the installation of a biomass boiler in Maubeuge.

2.4.3.8. Fondation d’entreprise Renault Group EFPD14d

The Fondation Renault Group responds to the quest for meaning among employees who wish to get involved.

In 2021, the Fondation d’entreprise Renault Group has set up a rounding-off program enabling employees who wish to do so to make voluntary donations each month, deducted directly from their pay slips, for the benefit of four associations: Les Restaurants du Cœur, l’Institut de l’Engagement, le Secours Populaire Français and Emmaüs Connect. The measure was maintained in 2022.

The Fondation Renault is committed to supporting them by matching 100% of their donations.

It also proposed that its employees become involved with the Secours Populaire “Les Pères Noël Verts” operation in

2.5.1.3. Highlights of 2022

In 2020, Renault Group underwent an audit of its system for preventing and detecting corruption and influence peddling by the French Anti-Corruption Agency (AFA) under Article 17 of the “Sapin II” law of December 9, 2016. The AFA sent its provisional report in the summer of 2021. Its receipt was followed by a procedure between the two parties, at the end of which Renault Group submitted its written observations, which were analyzed by the AFA before the release of its final report. Renault Group received this final report on February 9, 2022, and has since implemented action plans to address the auditors’ recommendations and observations.

In November 2022, the Renault Group Code of Ethics was updated and posted online at Renault.com and the Renault Group intranet. Widely deployed to all Renault Group employees worldwide, through

forms of various communication (kits, video, posters), it was drafted following some fifty interviews conducted with numerous organizational levels. It fuels Renault Group’s raison d’être and promotes values based on trust and respect between employees, customers, suppliers, partners and shareholders.

A video and a poster on the whistleblowing tool were distributed to all Renault Group factories around the world, as well as to support function sites. They explain how to make a fully confidential whistleblowing report and refer to the

WhistleB platform, Whistleblowing Centre via a dedicated QR Code easily downloaded using a smartphone.

The Anti-Corruption e-learning was updated in June 2022. Accessible to all Renault Group employees worldwide, it is posted on the Ethics and Compliance intranet and the

242

Learning@Alliance training module. All Renault Group employees throughout the world have been informed of it.

In November 2022, a new edition of the “Inspiring Ethics” seminar was held under the theme “Good & Evil – two powerful testimonies.” The

two speakers were: writer Laurence Devillairs, PhD, who spoke on “What does it mean to be a good person in the company?” and Frédéric Pierucci, a former ALSTOM corporate executive accused of corruption in 2013 who shared his experience. Organized by the Ethics and Compliance Department, the event was broadcast live and offline on the Renault Group intranet homepage. Held every year, it is part of a process to raise awareness of ethics and compliance among all Group employees.

Internal tools to promote and share the ethics and compliance policy (internal kits, videos, posters) are updated regularly. They offer clear and accessible information to Renault Group employees worldwide.

The ethics and compliance network

The

ethics and compliance

network

was further strengthened. It is composed of more than 90 Renault Group employees. It has country correspondents whose scope of action covers the countries where the Group is present as well as function and brand advisers. The correspondents and advisers may

be assisted deployment leaders.

Department

is responsible for overseeing regulatory compliance. It is responsible for ensuring that reliable systems are in place with the prescribing departments: Technical Regulations, Legal, Environment, etc. The Legal Department and the Risk Management Department provide support and assistance on this subject.

There is a method to assess existing procedures, validated by the CECG. The Group Ethics and Compliance Department applies this method to a list of regulatory areas selected with the Legal Department. In parallel with this assessment, a rating of the seriousness of the risk of regulatory non-compliance is established with each prescribing department (see “Risk factors“, chapter 4.2).

The system as a whole is managed by the internal monitoring procedure for regulatory compliance.

2.5.2 Strengthening the responsible purchasing approach in the supply chain EFPD14a EFPD15 EFPD17 EFPD18

The Group also extends its social, societal and environmental responsibility to its relationships with suppliers. Renault responsible Group implements a

purchasing policy along its entire supply chain. With regard to suppliers with whom the Group has an

established commercial relationship, the responsible purchasing approach is detailed in Renault Group’s Vigilance Plan, set out in section 2.2 ofthis document.

1. A mapping of risks, accompanied by methodology information;

2. Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of suppliers in light of the risk mapping, i.e. audit campaigns and evaluations via an Internet platform;

3. Actions to mitigate

risks

and prevent serious infringements:

● a responsible purchasing policy establishing the principles of responsible contractual relations with suppliers and covering the risks identified in the mapping;

● a decisive criterion when choosing suppliers and subcontractors;

● Monitoring of corrective action plans following audits at supplier sites;

● an ESG-focused purchasing team;

4. System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness;

5. A whistleblowing tool.

2.5.2.1. Specific work in the cobalt/electric batteries sector

Mapping of minerals and materials risks

Renault Group is particularly vigilant as regards to the origin of certain minerals and materials, for which risk mapping is also carried out.

In the light of Renault Group’s commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms, and particularly the fight against child labor in its supply chains of minerals and materials from high-risk countries, Renault Group works in priority since 2017 with the cobalt sector, as this mineral is used in electric batteries.

The Group selected a specialist audit firm in this sector to fully map its supply chain and perform on-site audits for the identified stakeholders.

Specific actions to mitigate risks and prevent claims

In 2019, this specialist firm carried out 17 site audits for certain suppliers and subcontractors in the cobalt supply chain. Audits were conducted at each level of the supply chain, starting with cathode suppliers and even down to some small-scale mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). No critical cases of non-compliance were identified, and

corrective action plans are being implemented. In 2020, the monitoring of action plans by cathode suppliers and certain refiners continued.

Based on the lessons learned from the audit campaign, Renaultis updating its risk mapping starting from 2021.

Renault Group is also reviewing its approach to risk management and audits, in particular to prepare for the European Battery Regulations that are being put in place. This requires an evolution of the organization and associated as

governance, well as continuous improvement in ESG assessments within the supply chain. Alongside these actions, in 2021 Renault Group also initiated direct partnerships with key raw material suppliers in its battery supply chain.

Following the partnership with VULCAN Energy set up in to Lithium35, Renault Group has also

2021 source agreements

with a sustainable supply in nickel and MANAGEM Group for a sustainable supply of cobalt37. These partnerships materialize a new step in the development of a more sustainable and transparent battery value chain.

TERRAFAME36 for implemented

Finally, in a risk anticipation approach, in 2022 Renault Group joined a group of NGOs, scientists and companies calling for a global moratorium on mining in the seabed, until it is not scientifically proven that this can be done in a sustainable way. The seabed, rich in minerals necessary for the manufacture of batteries, is essential in climate regulation and for the generation of means of subsistence for women and men.

See section 2.3.2.1, “Climate and energy efficiency”

2.5.2.3. A local integration strategy EFPD14a

Local integration is a major element of Renault Group’s purchasing policy because it can improve the Group’s competitiveness, reduce its

exposure to monetary

fluctuations and contribute to the development of the regions where it is located.

A local approach has numerous advantages leading to the reduction of costs. Thus, the local purchasing of parts can reduce transport and customs costs. This proximity also enables the Company to be more responsive, to adapt more quickly to changes in demand from its customers and to participate in local development and notably the local employment pool.

2.5.3 Tax policy EFPD16c

2.5.3.1. Applicable principles

1. In all countries where it is established, Renault Group ensures compliance with tax rules applicable to its activity, in accordance with international conventions and local laws.

2. In its relations with tax authorities, Renault Group aims at strictly complying with tax procedures and endeavors to maintain good relations in order to maintain its reputation. Renault Group endeavors to create a

lasting, transparent and professional relationship of trust with tax authorities of different countries and opts for special partnership programs with the tax authorities whenever possible.

3. Renault Group does not encourage or promote tax evasion foritself or for its subsidiaries.

To promote local integration, Renault Group has created dedicated teams in LATAM, Morocco and India. These teams, from purchasing, engineering, cost of goods sold and logistics, launch local calls for tenders to purchase parts that until then were imported.

In addition, Renault Group seeks to locate its suppliers as much as possible during the development phases of new projects.

The localization rate is intrinsically connected with local regulations, currency exchange

rates, the Group’s industrial activity (launching of new projects) and may vary on a year-to-year basis.

4. Renault Group applies OECD principles for transfer pricing, and intra-Group transactions comply with the arm’s-length principle. When local constraints require deviation from methodologies, such

OECD local constraints are documented.

5. Renault Group is fully committed to the implementation of regulations aimed at ensuring tax transparency at local, EU or international level.

6. Given the complexity of tax rules, Renault Group may differences of

have interpretation with local tax authorities. It then reserves the right to contest any adjustments that are deemed unfounded.

2.5.4 Cybersecurity and data protection

2.5.4.1. Cybersecurity

To manage risks and protect its data, Renault Group has set an

up organization/governance and operational

2.5.4.2. Personal data protection

Compliance with personal data protection rules opens up a golden opportunity to strengthen trust between Renault s.a.s. and its

stakeholders (shareholders, customers, suppliers and employees). Trust is an especially strong value for Renault s.a.s., and personal data protection is one ofthe main ethical bases for our actions.

Given this commitment, Renault designated a data protection officer (CIL) in 2011 to the French data protection authority (CNIL) with an extended scope. Subsequently, the Group implemented legal, technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with French data protection law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978. More recently, in May 2018, Renault Group appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in order to comply with the General Data Protection Since Regulation (GDPR). June 2019, this has been a full-time role performed by a dedicated expert who leads and coordinates actions to ensure that all of the Group’s activities are compliant with these standards.

The Data Protection Officer relies (i) on a network of local DPOs, GDPR correspondents (“Privacy Ambassadors”), in each department who are responsible for managing the compliance of personal data processing within their scope, assisted by a network of Privacy Representatives within their department, and (ii) on a legal team dedicated to personal data protection. In addition, multidisciplinary working groups comprising all of Renault’s function departments and/or the IT Department and, more specifically, the cybersecurity teams have been set up to intervene both periodically on governance monitoring and also on an ad hoc basis and upstream on the implementation of new projects involving the processing of personal data.

In order to make all Group employees aware of the protection of personal data, an e-learning training offer is offered to all employees. In order to optimize the time and

246

measures in matters of cybersecurity. Details of these measures are given in Chapter 1.5.1.4. Cybersecurity.

the comfort of the learners as well as the impact of these trainings, the e-learning is composed of:

● 3 fundamental modules lasting 25 minutes, intended for all employees;

● 8 targeted ten-minute modules for different businesses or regions (HR, IT, Marketing, Contractual relations, local specificities China & Korea, International data transfers, autonomous and connected vehicle, R&AE).

The offer is deployed in 11 languages and the different modules are assigned to employees according to their profession and scope. For example, three targeted modules (Contractual Relations, International Data Transfers and Local Specificities) have been assigned to employees of the Alliance Purchasing Organization) in addition to the fundamental

modules. A number of documents, frequently asked questions and guides for implementing personal data protection from the design stage are available to the business teams to ensure that all projects involving personal data processing are designed in compliance with the applicable regulations. Lastly, model appendices relating to personal data protection and security are made available to all Group lawyers and the various business lines to enable Renault Group to comply with regulations in its relations with third parties or even with other Group companies.

In order to monitor the Group’s compliance with personal data regulations, performance indicators are established each month and on demand as required to continuously monitor compliance and its development on an ongoing basis.

In view of its digital transformation, the development of its activities relating to connectivity and “data” (mobility services, connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles) in order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Renault Group launched a program to the implementation of

governance, processes and tools intended to protect the personal data of its employees and its customers/users. Renault Group also

is involved in working groups organized in particular by the Comité des Constructeurs Français d’Automobiles (CCFA) and by the European

2.5.5 Lobbying activities

The Group’s lobbying activities support its strategy, which is part of the ecological transition and aims to strengthen its industrial and technological activities at all its locations, particularly in France. The ambitions of this strategy take into account the requirements set by the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement, particularly in terms of combating greenhouse gas emissions.

In its Climate Report38, published for the first time in 2021, and in its first Integrated Report39, published in 2022, the Group reaffirms its strong commitments to sustainable mobility that respects its ecosystems.

The Group’s ambition is to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.

The Climate Report applies, in particular, the guidelines issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which advises companies on how to evaluate and disclose the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. The Group has supported the TCFD since 2019 and considers its recommendations to be a relevant framework for communicating to stakeholders about on climate issues in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

The Group’s lobbying strategy includes a continuous interaction with stakeholders (civil society, NGOs and public authorities). To this end, the Group’s proposals take into account impact studies of draft regulations or legislation on a variety of subjects: social, taxes, road safety, and the environment (including the fight against climate change).

2.6.1.1. Methodological comments on the Taxonomy

For this second year of application of the Delegated Act of Article 8 of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council 2020/852 of June 18, 2020, known as “Taxonomy,” Renault Group defined the eligibility of its

activities with respect to the climate change mitigation objective on the basis of the description of activities and NACE codes. Renault Group’s activities are thus eligible under the following sections:

Environmental

Climate change mitigation 6.5 Transportation by motorcycles, passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles

The purchase, financing, rental, leasing and operation of vehicles designated as belonging to categories M1 and N1, both of which fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council, or to category L (two- or three- wheel vehicles and four-wheel vehicles).

H49.32, H49.39 and N77.11

Financing, leasing of vehicles

The scope of eligibility of activities is as follows:

● Revenues: sales of Automotive goods, sales of goods to partners as well as rental income from assets and interest income on Sales Financing transactions as described Note 4 to in the Consolidated Financial Statements are eligible under sections 3.3 and 6.5 of the Taxonomy. Other Automotive services, Sales Financing and mobility services were not included;

● Investments (Capex): all acquisitions of intangible and tangible fixed assets, as detailed respectively in Note 10-A1 and Note 10-B to the Consolidated Financial Statements are eligible because they contribute to the design, manufacture, distribution of automotive goods as well as their financing and rental of vehicles;

● Operational expenses (Opex): non-capitalized Research and Development costs, as disclosed in Note 10-A2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, represent the bulk of eligible activities in addition to, for much smaller amounts, variable, short-term or low-value rental

expenses not restated under IFRS 16 Leases, as disclosed in Note 6-C to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Method used to determine the scope of activities with a substantial contribution

Turnover

To determine the substantial contribution of eligible vehicle-related activities, we analyzed sales figures based on vehicle model and powertrain technology. For spare parts, as we do not have the information system that would allow direct identification of parts fitted to low- emission vehicles, we estimated this turnover in

proportion to the "workshop" turnover achieved for low- emission vehicles.

Investments

To determine the substantial contribution of eligible vehicle-related activities, we analyzed the Capex and capitalized R&D expenditure based on vehicle model and powertrain technology in the same way as for turnover. . These investments have been reserved for new low- emission vehicle projects. Capital expenditure common to both electric and internal-combustion vehicles (such as for equipment fitted on multiple models) has been prorated for sales of low-emission vehicles in the medium- term sales plan.

Operational expenditure

The allocation of operational expenditure to economic activities followed the same logic as described for capital expenditure. Wherever possible, non-capitalized research and development costs have been directly allocated to the vehicles. They have been included if the vehicles in question make a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective. We have not included non- capitalized research and development costs directly attributable to vehicles that do not meet the selection criteria. Non-capitalized research and development costs that were not clearly attributable to a particular vehicle project – notably upstream research projects – and other operating costs have been included on a proportional basis using allocation formulas similar to those used for capital expenditure.

Method used to determine the KPIs of aligned activities

Turnover

It was not possible to identify, in a conservative manner, a sub-scope of activity in which the DNSH criteria relating to the prevention and control of pollution are verifiable. Therefore,the aligned turnover is declared zero.

Climate change adaptation

Under the TCFD (see 2.3.2.1.4.3), we carried out a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify sites likely to be affected by physical climate risks. The physical climate risks we identified were assessed on the basis of the life ofthe asset concerned.

Sustainable use and protection of water resources and marine resources

In all of the Group’s factories, the water resources needed for vehicle production are used with

a view sustainability and reducing the environmental footprint. In addition to complying with applicable regulations and the ban on

to

using any non-renewable water source, the factories are committed to reducing the quantities of water needed to produce a vehicle (see water section) and to reducing toxic metal emissions that can impact water resources (target of 35 % reduction in Ni and Zn emissions between 2013 and 2023). Strong actions have been implemented, such as:

● in the Douai and Palencia factories, replacement of pre- painting surface treatment technology with nickel-free technology;

●

in the Maubeuge or Flins factories: recycling of rainwater.

250

● Capex relating to development and industrialization studies carried out by the suppliers appointed for the manufacture of parts and equipment.

Methods used for checking DNSH criteria

The necessary

checks were carried out at vehicle production sites where low-emission passenger cars and light commercial vehicles offered by the Group's various brands are produced. outside China.

The planned in-depth investigations could not, to date, be carried out in China due to the health constraints put in place by the Chinese authorities.

Transition to a circular economy

The Group's eco-design standards applied to vehicles and batteries, which allow for the frugal use of rare materials, the integration of recycled materials, the predisposition of vehicles to their dismantling and end-of- life recycling (see 2.3.2.2).

95% of the mass of Group vehicles sold worldwide have been recyclable or recoverable (see 2.3.2.2.1) since 2007. All the low-emission vehicles that the Group finances, leases or operates were put on the road after this date.

At the end of the life of the electric vehicles marketed by the Group, their battery is collected and directed to a second life or recycled following a diagnosis of its state of health (see 2.3.2.2).

With regard to waste management, Renault Group and the Group’s European factories producing low-emission vehicles prioritize recycling by aiming to minimize any landfill and have set ambitious targets for 2023 (base year 2013):

● reduce the amount of non-recycled waste per vehicle produced by 30%;

● reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated per vehicle produced by 19%;

● reduce the amount of mixed non-hazardous waste generated by 26%;

● achieve 87% waste recovery.

All substances listed in Annexes I and II of the POP (Persistent Organic Pollutants) Regulation are banned from use in the Group (classified as black in internal standard 00-10-050). Our substance standards require that parts do not contain mercury or mercury compounds above the threshold of 0.1% m/m, or substances that deplete the ozone layer. The other REACH hazardous substances used are declared on www.Renault.com and in the SCIP database.

The Group is proactive in banning "SVHC" substances in new vehicle projects when an alternative solution exists. Renault voluntarily agrees not to use "SVHC" substances 7 years ahead of their regulatory ban on average, by contracting the RNES-B-0027 standard with its suppliers. For example, Renault is taking the initiative to replace UV absorbers that have been used to protect plastics from aging in the sun (such as 320, 327,

UV 328, 350 benzotriazoles) by banning them now.

By definition, low-emission vehicles meet the emission thresholds for clean light-duty vehicles set out in Table 2 of the Annex to Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.

Specific criteria for activity 6.5 "Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles"

The low-emission vehicles that the Group finances, leases or operates are all equipped with tires in external road noise and resistance classes that comply with the European requirements set out in EC Regulation 661/2009. In 2022, 40 different tire references could be fitted to the electric vehicles produced by the Group: 80% of them are both energy class A or B and noise class A or B, which places them, according to these criteria, in the 7.6% best tire references recorded in the EPREL database. However, the Group does not currently have information relating to the references of the tires currently fitted to the fleet of financed and leased vehicles, and therefore cannot make a robust estimate of the turnover corresponding to this criteria.

With a certified noise level well below 68 dBA, Renault electric vehicles have met, since 2021, the external noise limits applicable starting in 2024, thus contributing to the reduction of ambient noise and the quality of life in urban areas. All vehicles placed on the market by Renault in Europe in 2021 therefore comply with European regulation 540/2014/EC applicable to vehicles certified since July 2016, which require a maximum of 72 dBA (see 2.3.2.3.3)

● Core Conventions

of the

International Labour Organization (ILO);

● OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and

● Fundamental Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights.

All these initiatives lead to the conclusion that Renault Group meets the requirements of the minimum social safeguards.

UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights

Renault Group adheres to the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (see 2.1.3).

Core Conventions

of the

Handling of translation discrepancies

The Taxonomy was created by the European Commission to provide investors with a “common language and a clear definition of what is sustainable”. Having noted certain discrepancies between the English version and its translation into French, Renault Group has chosen to refer only to the original English version of the Taxonomy regulation, which is the most widely used in our industry, in order to favor the comparability of

performance indicators.

2.6.1.2. Methodological comments on a selection of environmental indicators

A. Lifecycle Assessment

Renault Group conducts lifecycle assessments in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. Renault uses the GaBi LCA (PE International) software and databases.

The lifecycle inventory describes all the elements that are taken into account in the lifecycle assessment of a vehicle. These data are related to lifecycle stages, from the vehicle’s manufacturing to its recycling, and including its usage phase:

● raw materials and manufacturing: thanks to Renault’s internal databases, each vehicle is described in terms of the raw materials it contains. These data, coupled with those in the GaBi database, allow all phases of the extraction

and processing of raw materials to be incorporated in the

the inventory. The data on manufacturing of vehicles integrated in the lifecycle inventory comes from

the annual environmental reporting for the industrial sites, which is subjected to verification by an Independent Third Party;

● usage and maintenance phase: the usage phase is calculated over 10 years and 150,000 km. The certified emissions for the regulatory cycle are taken into consideration. Moreover, the impacts associated with the energy consumption of vehicles (diesel, gasoline or electricity) are calculated from “well to wheel”, i.e., the emissions associated with the production and transport of the energy used are taken into account. In the usage phase, the maintenance activities performed

throughout the life of the vehicle (tire changes, oil changes, brake fluid, etc.) are taken into account;

● end-of-life: emissions related to recycling processes are accounted for. The recycling of materials from vehicles enables the use of virgin material and associated emissions to be avoided. The emissions avoided in this way are deducted from the carbon footprint.

All potential impacts are calculated using the GaBi software.

B. Carbon footprint

The purpose of determining Renault’s carbon footprint is to measure and propel the reduction of greenhouse gas

252 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

emissions in Renault Group. The following methodologies have accordingly been chosen:

● the carbon footprint is compared with the number of vehicles sold;

● in the event of sales or acquisitions, the reference value (2010) is corrected to take into account or subtract the site’s emissions at that date in order to measure changes in the Group’s carbon footprint in relation to 2010 on a comparable scope of activity;

● if there is an update to the model in the GaBi tool used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the materials and parts purchased (see above), the 2010 reference value is recalculated with the new database in order to measure the changes to the indicator on a comparable basis. This happened in 2015 and 2018. In addition, to factor in the environmental performance of suppliers between model updates in the GaBi tool, a carbon performance factor of -2% per year is applied;

● the carbon footprint is calculated for a constant scope of emissions.

When the scope

is amended, the 2010 benchmark value is recalculated. In 2017, the calculation scope was extended to include: RRG, vehicles bought from and sold to partners, filling of air-conditioning systems (for premises and vehicles), vehicle and engine testing and indirect emissions linked to purchase thermal energy. In 2018 two foundries were integrated into the scope without recalculating the 2010 benchmark value, capacity extension

this being a rather than an integration of a pre-existing entity. In 2020, vehicle air- conditioning maintenance was taken into account, with a recalculation of the 2010 reference value. The conversion factors between certification cycles were also updated.

The carbon footprint for Renault does not include a prospective dimension. The value retained for the carbon intensity of fuel and industrial processes is that of the vehicle release year and does not vary during the lifecycle of the vehicle (10 years, 150,000 km).

The table on the next page indicates the scope of emissions covered by the Renault carbon footprint indicator as well as the origin of the data used and the level of external verification applied. To facilitate understanding, the categories of the Renault carbon footprint are matched to those of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

► turnover from the used vehicle reconditioning activity of the Flins Refactory (UV Factory);

► revenue related

to sales of remanufactured components (“standard exchange” range);

► turnover of the Gaia, INDRA and Boone Comenor Metalimpex subsidiaries);

► turnover of the Mobilize subsidiary linked to second-life or dynamic storage applications (Advanced Battery Storage) for electric vehicle batteries.

This indicator is published on the basis of constant material prices to ensure continuity in the monitoring of performance. 2019, the year considered representative of the "average" prices of the main materials taken into account in the indicator (steel, copper, platinum, rhodium, palladium and polypropylenes) was chosen as the reference year. As 2022 saw a sharp rise in material prices, the indicator stands at €972m before correction for the price effect, and €651m after correction based on 2019 material prices.

2.6.1.3. Methodological comments on the table “Site environmental indicators for 2022”

Reporting for environmental indicators

the was conducted in accordance with the stipulations of the 2022 Environmental Protocol for Renault Sites. The following is an explanation of the main methodological choices of the Protocol. This Protocol is available on request from the Environment Department of the Group’s Health, Safety, Environment and Ergonomics Division (DHSEE).

Scope

The “scope” of the reported data covers the industrial subsidiaries (body assembly, final assembly, powertrain and foundry) and the support sites (product and process design, logistics) in the Renault Group financial scope of consolidation.

Compared with the 2021 scope, the following entities have leftthe reporting scope:

● Togliatti, Izhevsk and Moscow following the sale of the sites on May 16, 2022;

● Choisy: transfer of activity to the Flins Refactory between November 2021 and June 2022;

● ACI Villeurbanne: transfer of activity to the Meyzieu site, ceasing operations on February 28, 2022.

Note: the AlpineF1 Team sites in Viry-Châtillon and Enstone are excluded from the scope of environmental reporting, as the former produces engines exclusively for competition vehicles (Formula 1), and the latter designs and assembles these vehicles. These two sites represent less than 1% of the Group's production and workforce.

Impacts of suppliers or third parties present on site are not included, with the exception of the sites listed under the “Site environmental indicators in 2022” table. All impacts arising from employee catering facilities, CSR activities and social partner activities are included in the data for the Renault sites.

The data for sites included in the scope of reporting in year Y are consolidated with those of other sites only from year Y+1. As such, the information on the Puiseaux site is consolidated forthis exercise.

254

Data from Gaia are taken into account at sites where Gaia operates, except the Flins site (France), where Gaia waste is covered by a specific contract. The waste generated by Gaia at the Flins site represents less than 1% of the total waste generated by the Group.

The drinking water production and Davidesti waste storage activity at the Pitesti site (Dacia) were removed from the reporting scope. For the drinking water activity, consumption is not related to the site activity and represents 2% of the Group total for external water supply and less than 1% for all other indicators. For landfill, the quantities represent less than 1% of the Group total.

Data control and consolidation procedures

Specialized experts from the Group DHSEE check the consistency of data at each site. These checks include a comparison with data from previous years and an analysis of the impact of events occurring on site during the year.

The

environmental data presented in the Universal Registration Document have also been subjected to external verification by the independent third party, KPMG. Their conclusions are set out in the report in section 2.6.6.

Vehicle production

The vehicles counted are those that have gone through the fall-off mechanical line manufacturing stage, which is standard for all bodywork/assembly plants. From this counting point, the vehicles leave the assembly line. They can be driven and are considered to be manufactured, even if they have to be reworked and/or tested afterwards.

Water consumption

Water consumption is expressed in thousands of cubic meters (m3 ).

Measured volumes include water obtained by pumping (underground water) and/or

and surface external networks (drinking water, industrial water). Collected rainwater (Aveiro, Giheung, Guyancourt, Flins, Maubeuge and Medellin) is also included.

Liquid waste

Data on pollutant flows are based on measurements of effluents after they have been treated in the Group’s plants and before they are discharged to the outside. Discharges from some plants may subsequently be treated in municipal treatment plants (see plant codes 2.6.1.4).

Under the Reporting Protocol, the frequency of discharge analysis must comply with the regulations applicable to the Renault sites.

The quantity of COD (Chemical

Oxygen Demand) represents the flow of organic pollutants discharged. This quantity is expressed in metric tons per year.

The Zn+Ni quantity represents the sum of the zinc and nickel flows discharged. This quantity is expressed in metric tons per year.

The data presented only take into account the discharges relating to metals and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), for which concentration and flow must be measured by law, and the discharges from the plants in Bursa (Turkey), Curitiba (Brazil), Santa Isabel de Cordoba (Argentina) and Casablanca (Morocco), for which voluntary controls are taken into account in light of the significant contribution of these discharges to the Group’s impacts.

The Moscow, Santa Isabel de Cordoba, Curitiba, Casablanca (SOMACA) and Batilly (Sovab) sites are subject to specific regulatory requirements and receive

an exemption on the calculation methodology of the specific flows.

For sites that are not subject to a regulatory requirement to measure pollutant flows or to consolidate voluntary controls at the Group level, the reported value is noted as “NC”. Black water discharges, for which there is no regulatory measurement and/or reporting obligation, are not included in the water discharges. This concerns 39% of manufacturing sites (one of which is covered in a partial statement) and 69% of engineering, logistics and support sites.

Air emissions

Greenhouse gas (GHG) discharges include the direct and indirect GHG emissions and are expressed in metric tons of CO2 equivalent(CO2e).

Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are derived from an inventory of GHG sources conducted in 2004 and updated in part in 2021. Following this inventory, Renault modified its guidelines to better reflect the total emissions of Group

Renault and to comply with the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the

French by protocol developed

Entreprises pour l’Environnement (EPE).

Emissions from the following sources were included:

● combustion of fossil energies transported to the site and those transformed by the site for third parties;

● coolant fill-up of the air-conditioning systems fitted in vehicles produced by the plant. Only HFC 134a fill-up is taken into account. It is not considered pertinent to

declare HFO1234yf use under French legislation (Article R. 543-75 of the French Environment Code excludes this gas from coolant fluids) and in view of its negligible impact on fuel combustion emissions during testing of engines, gearboxes, endurance vehicles and on roller benches;

02

● forklift trucks using compressed natural gas or propane;

● fuel consumption relating to Renault’s company vehicles (taxi shuttles, service pools,

vehicles, handling equipment, etc.);

● coolant leaks from fixed air conditioning systems for premises and processes with a nominal load of more than 5 teqCO2;

● the oxidation of carbon entering the melting furnaces that is not found in the outgoing cast iron and is therefore released during melting;

● the oxidation of VOCs incinerated by incinerators and resulting in CO2 emissions.

These emissions make up more than 95% of the direct GHG emissions produced by Renault Group.

The following emission sources have been excluded from the reporting scope, since the corresponding emissions

are not significant (less than 1% of total direct GHG emissions).

It is not yet possible to correctly assess certain emissions, so the following are not included in the reporting scope:

● emissions associated with transport on sites not listed above among the emissions counted (particularly the delivery by a road haulier external to Renault Group);

● fugitive emissions occurring when tanks of coolant (for vehicle air conditioning systems) are filled and emptied;

● emissions linked to SF6-type circuit breaker facilities.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) indirect discharges are related to purchased electricity, steam and hot water. The emission factors used for the 2022 reporting are:

● for electricity, those published directly by suppliers or, if these are not available, those published by the IEA (International Energy Agency) in its publication IEA (2022), Emission Factors;

● for steam and hot water, data calculated on the basis of information provided by suppliers.

Emissions factors used in the calculations of SO2, NOx and GHG emissions are taken from the CITEPA’s OMINEA National Inventory Report (updated in March 2022) or Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 and are consistent with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The emission factor from fixed combustion facilities of low- NOx natural gas burners was calculated in 2011, based on an internal study of 88% of sites in the scope having low-NOx burners. The factor thus obtained (0.0266kg/MWh LHV) is the average of the factors obtained at each site weighted by the power of the facilities.

The air emissions of SO2 and NOx counted represent the emissions from the combustion of fossil energies in fixed

all sites, excluding on-site combustion facilities at

transport.

SO2 and NOx emissions generated by engine tests are not taken since

into account,

the SO2

emissions are insignificant and NOx emissions are difficult to calculate (unreliable assessment method).

The air emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) included in the data are the emissions produced when bodywork is painted (body assembly factories). The application of paint on bumpers and on parts and accessories is not taken into account.

The indicator shown corresponds to the metric tons of VOC emissions and the ratio of VOC emissions per m2 of painted vehicle surface. The consolidated ratio for the Group corresponds to the total VOC emissions generated by the body assembly plants divided by the total of the painted surfaces.

Waste

The waste reported is the waste that leaves the site’s geographical scope; the quantities are expressed in metric tons.

Construction waste from Renault sites is not reported unless a contractual clause explicitly states that the construction company is notresponsible for it.

The waste reported includes hazardous waste (HW), non- hazardous waste (NHW), and construction site waste.

For the sake of clarity, non-hazardous waste is presented in two subcategories:

● metallic waste

from production

processes (scrap metals, machining chips, etc.);

● non-metallic waste (mixed ordinary waste, for example).

Foundry waste is waste specifically related to the foundry process. As such, mixed non-hazardous waste produced by a foundry is not considered foundry waste.

Non-recycled waste is waste for which the treatment network is designated by European treatment codes D or R1 (energy recovery).

Recovered waste is all waste that is recycled (material recovery) or incinerated with energy recovery (energy recovery, treatment code R1).

Energy Consumption

This metric represents the quantity of gas, heating oil, LPG (excluding vehicles), biomass, steam, hot water, electricity and solar thermal energy consumed at Renault sites, expressed in MWh LHV (Lower Heating Value). However, the data indicated does not include the propane used by forklift trucks or the fuel consumed by the site (engine and gearbox testing, company vehicles).

The primary or converted energy supplied to third parties is not included. The purpose of the energy consumption indicators is to reflect the energy performance of the Group’s manufacturing processes.

The LHVs are consistent with Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the monitoring and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions, with the exception of LHV of natural gas from the Spanish plants from the March 2022 (Spanish) national greenhouse gas inventory report. The LHVs are consistent with the emissions reported in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

Data collection

Several methods are used to collect employee data:

● in 2022, the HR management system, People@Renault, is deployed in 38 countries. It collects part of the data for the entire scope and ensures the overall consistency of results;

● a questionnaire is sent to the Clusters. This questionnaire includes a number of indicators: headcount by gender and age, number of recruitment and redundancies, absenteeism number

rate,

and subjects of major collective agreements signed during the year, number of employees covered

by

a collective bargaining agreement and selected at corporate level from the most relevant agreements, total cumulative training hours in the year, training access rate, average training rate per employee and percentage of employees with disabilities. Each indicator has a specific definition and calculation method that is shared with each of the Clusters. This questionnaire also enables data to be cross-referenced with last year’s figures to monitor developments;

● for the data specific to health and safety (number of occupational accidents, commuting accidents and occupational illnesses), a reporting process with monthly consolidation is put in place with the Group entities. Each month, the data is checked at the corporate level, using the protocol, to ensure the quality of their classification. A

digital reporting tool is being rolled out, contributing to improving the reliability of data.

A continuous improvement process for these collection methods is in place, taking into account

the recommendations of the statutory auditors.

Definitions and calculation methods for labor-related indicators

Total workforce: number of employees holding an employment contract with the entity (permanent or fixed- term). Every employee on the payroll is counted as “one” regardless of his or her contractual working time (or activity rate). All employees on the payroll are counted, even if they are sent to another entity.

Average Group = (Group workforce at December 31 of the previous year + Group workforce at December 31 of the current year)/2.

workforce

Average country workforce = (country workforce at December 31 of the previous year + country workforce at December 31 of the current year)/2.

Average active workforce: the average active workforce is equal to the total registered workforce for the entity concerned, excluding “inactive” employees. The active workforce is measured every month. The average active workforce is equal to the average calculated over 12 months.

Financial statements

“Inactive”: persons appearing in the entity’s workforce but physically absent from the entity for a long period and paid only partially or not at all. This category consists mainly of unworked notice periods, leave of absence unpaid for various reasons

including leave, long-term parental

sabbatical leave, end of professional career leave including exemptions from activity in France, leave for business creation, parental educational leave, absence due to long- term illness or accident after using up the amount of leave paid by the Company (amount linked to the current work absence), and military service. Persons on sick leave (excluding long-term) and on maternity or paternity leave are not considered as “inactive” employees.

Number of Group redundancies: termination of permanent contract or early termination of fixed-term contract by the employer for one or more reasons that may or may not relate personally to the employee in question, and which may be either collective or

individual. Conventional severance, voluntary departure plans, non-continuation at the end of a trial period, and abandonment of post are not considered as redundancy.

Number of Group recruitments: hiring on permanent contract and fixed-term contracts.

Top governing bodies: positions comprising members of the BoM (Board of Management), CMC (Corporate Management Committee) and BMC (Brand Management Committee).

Senior Management Positions: Positions of responsibility: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the

Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology. This represents 4,000 positions, within the scope deployed in the People@Renault tool (excluding Avtovaz and RRG).

Management Positions: positions

of responsibility: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology. This represents 10% of the Group’s positions in the scope defined in the People@Renault tool (excluding Avtovaz and RRG), i.e. 11,000 positions.

Number of hours of training: cumulative number of training hours delivered, whether the training is provided on site by internal/external trainers, outside the company by a training organization, or followed remotely. This indicator measures the overall training effort.

Training access rate: number of employees trained at least once during the year who are still with the Company at the end of the year as a percentage of the active workforce at year-end.

Average training hours per employee: total hours of employee training carried out during the year for employees present at the end of the year, as a percentage of the active workforce at the end of the year.

Employment rate of people with disabilities: percentage of employees with disabilities in the total workforce as of December 31. It should be noted however, that it is difficult to prepare statistics that accurately reflect the number of disabled employees, given the different regulations and

Absenteeism (absence due to unforeseen circumstances): the absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is calculated on the basis of the average active workforce (permanent + fixed-term contracts) and the theoretical yearly number of working days.

The number of days of absence is expressed in working days, excluding days of furloughs, layoffs, strikes, training and leave (including maternity and paternity leave).

Formula: number of absence days per year/(active workforce x number of theoretical days per year) × 100. The choice of assumptions for the calculation of theoretical days number is left up to the entities, since local factors may result in minor differences.

Health and safety indicators:

FR1 rate: frequency rate of occupational accidents requiring more significant medical treatment than first aid for Renault and temporary employees. This rate corresponds to a list of injuries of injuries that reach or exceed a certain severity threshold and on which Renault Group intends to prioritize its actions.

FR2 rate: frequency rate of occupational accidents with sick leave involving Renault and temporary employees (several additional exclusions compared with F2).

The FR1 and FR2 rates correspond to the incident rates divided by 1,000,000 hours worked.

Example:

FR2 = Number ofincidents requiring first aid

× 1,000,000

Number of hours of risks exposure

Accidents of temporary workers are included in the FR1 and FR2 indicators from 2018.

G1 severity rate: [Number of days of sick leave during the year due to occupational accidents that year or in previous years - number of days of sick leave due to accidents that were contested or where a dispute was won] x 1,000/number of hours of exposure to occupational risks during the year.

Occupational illnesses: rate of occupational illnesses contracted by Renault employees following prolonged exposure to an occupational risk (noise, chemicals, posture, etc.), reported as such to an external body if the regulations in force in the country so provide. Rate of reported occupational illness per 1,000 employees to end-2016. Occupational illness rate reported per million hours of exposure to occupational risks from 2017 onwards. This rate includes occupational illnesses, reported with or without sick leave.

Accidents on public roads: accidents involving Renault employees on public roads while commuting to work or traveling on business.

2.6.3.1. Methodological comments on key societal reporting figures

The information included in the comprehensive reporting of societal initiatives is collected from a network of correspondents covering all countries in which Renault operates. This information includes:

●

actions which are divided into areas: education, road safety, integration through employment and "others" (grouping communication around ESG, humanitarian aid, culture, sport, health, etc.);

four main

● the purpose of each initiative determines the category to which it is assigned. For example, donating a vehicle for transporting children to school would be classified under “education”;

● actions stemming from Renault S.LA.S. philanthropy (see 2.4.3.8).

The various CSR initiatives undertaken internally by Renault Group employees (disability awareness, etc.) are included in societal investments.

However, donations in kind (donations and loans of vehicles in particular) and the provision of employees (hourly cost) are not counted in societal investments. However, we can indicate for information that the 465 donated vehicles in

2022 by the Engineering Department to firefighters in France and Europe, as well as to the GIGN and RAID give rise to a tax receipt of €2.294m.

2.6.4 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index

Renault Group decided to adopt the SASB standard from the 2020 financial year.

The SASB is a standard setter that is part of the IFRS Foundation. It defines material standards for reporting on sustainable development by industrial sector mainly for investors (i.e. topics reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial performance).

The SASB has developed a comprehensive set of 77 industry manufacturing standards that were published in November 2018. They identify a minimum set of sustainable development

themes and associated indicators that a company characteristic of an industry segment should publish because of their materiality.

2.6.5 Extra-financial ratings and indexes

02

The development of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) gives rise to the need for an extra-financial rating. This rates the Company not only on its financial performance but also on its attitude toward the environment, respect for social values, societal commitment and corporate governance.

Each area analyzed produces a rating based on different criteria (transparency, innovation, communication, etc.) and is weighted to obtain a final rating. This serves as a reference for fund managers and investors who wish to invest in companies that perform well in terms of governance and environmental and social responsibility. Some of these rating agencies have developed, most of the time in partnership with providers of equity indexes, some indexes composed of the top-rated companies for environmental, social or governance (ESG) aspects.

Renault Group is evaluated each year by the main international extra-financial rating agencies on the basis of its public and declarative information. These agencies generally reserve access to the results of their

assessments for their own customers.

Extra-financial performance

The CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), founded in 2000, is tasked by a group of institutional investors to enhance understanding of the impacts of climate change on the value of the assets managed by its signatories. It is an

independent not-for-profit organization which collates and maintains a large database relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

Since 2002, the CDP has sent annual requests to companies for information in a standard format about their greenhouse gas emissions and policies on climate change. The CDP includes, in particular, members of the FT500 (the 500 largest companies in the world by market capitalization).

2.6.6 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors, appointed as independent third party, on the verification of the non-financial statement

Forthe year ended 31 December 2022

To the Annual General Meeting,

In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of your company (hereinafter the “entity”) appointed as independent third party, and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (COFRAC) under number 3-188444 , we have undertaken a limited assurance

engagement on the historical financial information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the entity’s procedures (hereinafter the “Guidelines“), for the year ended … (hereinafter, the “Information“ and the “Statement“ respectively), presented in the Group's management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225‑102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).

At the request of the entity, we conducted works designed to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the information selected by the entity and identified by the sign √.

Limited assurance conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed, as described under the “Nature and scope of procedures“ and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.

Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection of non-financial information

Based on the procedures performed, as set out in the “Nature and scope of our work“ and “Nature and scope of additional work on the information selected by the entity and identified by the sign √“ sections of this report, and the evidence collected, the information selected by the entity and identified with the symbol √ in the Statement has been prepared, in all materialrespects, in accordance with the Guidelines.

Preparation ofthe non-financial performance Statement

The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practices on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.

Consequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarized in the Statement and available on the Entity’s website or on request from its headquarters.

Inherent limitations in preparing the Information

The Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used forits preparation and presented in the Statement.

Responsibility of the entity

Management ofthe Entity is responsible for:

We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted around fifteen interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement.

The Chief Executive Officer must inform the Board of Directors of any external growth transaction and any acquisition or disposal of any ownership in any company, whether existing or to be created, where the amount exceeds €60 million.

The Board of Directors shall determine every year the total amount of

sureties (cautions), endorsements (avals) or guarantees (garanties), which the Chief Executive Officer may provide without requesting the Board’s specific authorization.

Chief Executive Officer's obligation to hold shares

Pursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors decided at its meeting on July 29, 2020, to set the minimum number of registered shares to be held by the Chief Executive Officer until the end of his term of office at 5,000 shares.

This minimum holding obligation complements the obligation for the Chief Executive Officer to retain, until the end of his term of office, 25% of the shares resulting

from the free allocation of shares (for more details on the retention obligation, see chapter 3.2.4.2 of the Universal registration document).

The minimum holding requirement ensures that a Chief Executive Officer who does not yet own shares resulting from free allocations of shares is aligned with the interests of shareholders upon taking office.,

3.1.2 Composition of the Board of Directors

The members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting, with the exception of the Director designated by the French State pursuant to Article 4 of French Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014,

on corporate governance and equity transactions in companies with public shareholding and the Directors representing the employees.

The term of office for Directors is four years. Pursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, these terms of office are staggered, to avoid them all ending and coming up for renewal at the same time.

Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the composition of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors determines and regularly reviews the desirable balance of its composition, particularly in terms of diversity (representation of women and men, nationalities, age, qualifications and professional experiences.

● 1 director representing employee shareholders

Pursuant

to

the Company's

bylaws,

a member representing employee shareholders, and an alternate, are elected by the Ordinary General Meeting from among two full candidates and

two alternate candidates nominated by employee shareholders.

Each full candidate is designated, respectively, along with his or her alternate, by:

● the Supervisory Boards of company mutual investment funds (FCPE) whose assets are composed of shares of the Company, in accordance with Article L. 214-165 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, and whose unit

holders are current or former employees of the Company or of an affiliated company as defined in Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and

● employees of the Company or of an affiliated company as defined in Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code who directly hold registered shares of the Company (i) following free share allocations made under Article L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code and authorized by a decision of the Extraordinary General Meeting after August 7, 2015, (ii) within the framework of the employee savings plan or (iii) acquired under Article 31-2 of French Order 2014-948 of August 20, 2014, on the governance and capital transactions of companies with public shareholding and Article 11 of Law No. 86-912 of August 6, 1986 on privatization, in the version applicable prior to the entry into force of the above-mentioned Order.

Onboarding and training program for directors

New directors benefit from an onboarding program in the period following their appointment. As part of this program, new directors are given a presentation of the Group, its governance and its various activities during meetings with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officers of the Group's brands (Renault, Dacia and Alpine, Mobilize), the managers of the business lines (engineering, manufacturing, quality, legal affairs, human resources, financial services and banking), and the Alliance General Secretary. In addition, the new directors take part in visits to Group sites and factories.

The three directors representing employees and the director representing employee shareholders benefit

from in-house training provided by Renault Group by

employees and training provided external organizations. This training helps them to fully exercise their office by rapidly acquiring the specific skills required of a company director.

Diversity policy applied to the Board of Directors

Pursuant to Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code, the Board, of Directors has defined a diversity policy based on its past practices.

Policy criteria

The composition of the Board of Directors seeks a balance notably in terms of diversity (representation of women and nationalities,

age,

qualifications and men,

professional experience). More specifically:

● regarding the size of the Board of Directors, the number of Board of Directors members must be such as to enable reconciliation of the skills, independence and specificities of Renault’s shareholding;

● the Board of Directors, while complying at least with legal requirements and the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code in terms of gender balance, considers that it benefits from being diverse in its composition (gender, nationality, culture);

● in terms of skills, the Company seeks above all the complementarity of skills, profiles and experiences but also their relevance to the Company’s strategy and to the challenges it faces;

● in terms of seniority, the Company seeks a balance between experience within the Board of Directors and progressive renewal of its composition;

● the of Directors Board expects a high level of commitment and ethics from each of its members.

Policy implementation

To implement this diversity policy, the Board of Directors uses annual evaluations of its work (for more details on the Board’s evaluation, see section 3.1.7 of the Universal registration document). The progressive and planned renewal of the terms of offices makes it possible to anticipate the skills to be renewed or to evolve according to the evolution of the industry and of the markets in which the Company operates.

Implementation of the diversity policy in 2022:

● the Board of Directors currently includes 16 Directors. This number remains higher than the average for CAC 40 companies, but is explained by the level of representation of the employees and of the reference shareholders in accordance with the law, the articles of association or agreements entered into with Nissan, and the desire to

ensure the presence

of a majority of Independent Directors. As such, the independence rate of the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2022, was 66.7%2

● the number of women on the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2022, stands at five, i.e. a feminization rate of 41.7%2 . Moreover, one of the Board of Directors’ three committees is chaired by a woman;

The Board of Directors also oversees the deployment of the Group's diversity policy by Senior Management. In light of this, the Board of Directors and the Strategy and Sustainability Committee annually review the Group's diversity and inclusion policy, and more specifically the policy on the balanced representation of women and men on the governing bodies.

At its meeting on February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the Executive Management, set a target of 30% representation of women in 2030, 35% in and 50% in

2035 2050 in

the management bodies,

including the Leadership Team and the Brand Management Committees, on the one hand, and for employees in management positions, on the other.

At its meeting on February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors was informed of the results achieved during the 2022 financial year and the procedures that the Company has put in place to achieve these objectives.

In addition, to take into account the new objectives introduced by the "Rixain Law" (Law no. 2021-1774 of December 24, 2021, aimed at accelerating economic and professional equality), the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the Executive Management, increased the gender diversity objective within the management bodies to 30% of women by 2025.

Independence ofthe Board of Directors

The Board of Directors is committed to respecting the principle of independence, which is set forth in its Board Charter.

Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the independence of the directors

At least half of the directors, not including any directors elected by the employees (administrateurs élus par le personnel salarié) and the director representing the employee shareholders (administrateur représentant les salariés actionnaires), shall be considered as independent according to the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

However, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, may consider that a director who meets the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code may not be considered as independent given his/her particular situation or that of the Company. Conversely, the Board may consider that a director who does not meet the aforementioned criteria should nevertheless be considered as independent.

Pursuant to the Board Charter, the Board of Directors refers to the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code to identify situations that may compromise the exercise of freedom ofjudgment by directors.

In any event, it is recalled that, pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code and in accordance with the Board Charter, every director is under an obligation to inform the Board of Directors of any potential conflict of interest situation and to refrain from attending the debate and from participating in the vote ofthe corresponding deliberation. Each year, the Company sends a questionnaire to each director in order to assess his or her independence in accordance with the criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

The Governance and Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors shall also review the classification of each director as independent in light of these same criteria.

Each year, the Governance and Compensation Committee shall discuss for each director, whether such director should be considered as independent, and the independence of each director shall be examined on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors in light of the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Upon appointment of a new director or renewal of the terms of office a director, the question of whether such director may be considered as independent should also be discussed.

As part of this review, the Governance and Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors pays particular attention to the assessment of the materiality of the business relationships between the directors and the Company, both from the standpoint of the Group and of the relevant director. This assessment shall be carried out in the light of qualitative criteria, such as the nature of the business relationships, and quantitative criteria, such as the amounts committed under these relationships.

Accordingly, to qualify as independent, the Board of Directors ensures that there were no significant cash flows between the Company and any company of which Company’s directors are directors or Executive Officers, in particular by examining the share these companies account for in the Company’s revenue.

(2) The Directorrepresenting employee shareholders and the Directors representing employees are not taken into account for the calculation of the independence rate in accordance with the recommendations ofthe AFEP-MEDEF Code.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors examined the situation of Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, given his capacity as director of Nissan and Chairman of Renault s.a.s.forthe period from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020.

The AFEP-MEDEF Code states that one of the criteria that the Board of Directors must assess to possibly exclude someone from the status of independent director is that of “not being or not having been, during the past five years, an employee, executive offer, or director of a company that the company consolidates.” According to the AFEP-MEDEF Code implementation guide, this recommendation also applies when a director holds “an office in a company in which the first company holds a non-controlling but significant stake, or in a sister company”.

It

is recalled that

Nissan

is not

a company

fully consolidated by Renault. Renault has significant influence over Nissan and therefore accounts for its interest in Nissan using the equity method (for more details on Renault's shareholding in Nissan, see note 12 in chapter 5.2.2.6.2 ofthe Universal registration document).

The Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, with a view to developing and strengthening cooperation between the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard's freedom of judgement and independence with respect to Renault.

302

Furthermore, should such a situation give rise to any conflict of interest, the provisions of the Board Charter requiring the director in question to abstain from participating in the deliberations and votes of the Board of Directors would apply.

In addition, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation

of

the Governance

and

Compensation Committee, considered that the performance by Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard of the duties of Chairman of Renault s.a.s. from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020, was of an exceptional and purely temporary nature, during the time required for the Board of Directors to conduct the succession process for the Chief Executive Officer and until the arrival of Mr. Luca de Meo on July 1, 2020. The Board of Directors therefore considered that this exceptional situation was not such as to call into question the independence of Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard at the end of this temporary term of office.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors also reviewed Mr. Pierre Fleuriot’s situation with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code in view of his capacity as director of Nissan.

The Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that the appointment of the Lead Independent Director of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, with a view to developing and strengthening cooperation between the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Pierre Fleuriot’s freedom of judgment and independence with respect to Renault.

Following the analysis of the independence of the Directors, on February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and

Compensation Committee and in accordance with the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, drew up the following list of directors qualifying as independent directors as of December 31, 2022: Ms. Catherine Barba,

Ms. Miriem Bensalah-Chaqroun, Ms. Marie-Annick Darmaillac, Ms. Annette Winkler, Mr. Bernard Delpit, Mr. Frédéric Mazzella, Mr. Pierre Fleuriot and Mr. Jean- Dominique Senard.

whom were deemed to be independent. Pursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the

directors representing the employees and the director representing employee shareholders have not been taken into account when calculating the independence rate, which is thus 66.7%.

● convene, at least once per year, if the functions of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are combined, a meeting of the Board’s members in the absence of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, as the case may be, of the Chief Operating Officer(s). Those meetings shall be convened, in particular, to assess the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, as the case may be, of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s), and to examine their respective compensation; the Lead Independent Director shall preside over the debates during such meetings;

● ensure that the Independent Directors liaise with the other members of the Board of Directors and General Management; the Lead Independent Director shall work to ensure that the directors are able to fulfill their duties under the best possible and, in

● be consulted by the Chairman regarding the agenda of each meeting of the Board of Directors and the schedule of meetings; the Lead Independent Director may propose to the Chairman additional agenda items for a Board of Directors’ meeting or the convening of a Board of Directors’ meeting regarding a particular matter, whose importance or urgency would justify holding an extraordinary meeting; convene the Board in exceptional circumstances, after having sought the opinion of all Committees Chairs; ● report on the assessment of his/her duties once a year to the Board of Directors; the Lead Independent Director may be invited by the Chairman to report on his/her activities during Annual General Meetings.

Information, follow-up and exchange points with the CEO took place at each Board meeting and two specific Board meetings were dedicated to the strategic plan.

In addition to the meetings on strategic issues, the Board of Directors made site visits:

● The Board went to Douai, to one of the sites of the Electricity center, to visit the factory, and in particular the assembly line of the electric Megane E-Tech, as well as the future site of the Envision

AESC battery gigafactory. The Board members were also able to test drive the Megane E-Tech, as well as the Group's other new 2022 models, the Dacia Jogger and the Renault Austral.

● The Board of Directors also spent a day discovering the future vehicles of the Renault Group (line-up of the Renault, Dacia and Alpine brands). The Board first attended an in-depth presentation at the Design Centre (Technocentre in Guyancourt) of the vehicle ranges scheduled for launch in the 2023-2025 period, and then visited the various stands at the Pre-Show organised ahead of the Paris Motor Show to present the new vehicles and concepts to the international press.

3.1.7 Evaluation of the Board of Directors

Each year, the Board of Directors carries out an evaluation of its composition, organization and operation with a view to improving the efficiency of its work and, at least once every three years, a formal evaluation with the assistance of external consultants.

Formal evaluations took place in 2017 and 2020.

The Board of Directors conducted a self-evaluation of its operations and of the operations of its Committees for 2022.

All Board members answered

a questionnaire. The conclusions of the evaluation were presented at the Governance and Compensation Committee meeting on February 9, 2023, and then at the Board of Directors meeting on February 15, 2023.

The purpose of the questionnaire and of the interviews with the members of the Board was to evaluate the following themes:

● the composition, role, structure, missions and operation ofthe Board of Directors and its Committees;

● the relationships between the Board of Directors and Senior Management;

● the directors' contribution and collective efficiency;

● the follow-up on the points for improvement identified in

the previous evaluation.

The evaluation provided an opportunity to learn from the experience of recent events, and to reassess the ways in which the Board of Directors and its Committees operate.

In 2022, the evaluation of the Board of Directors and its Committees highlighted the following positive items:

● the strengthening of the bond and the better cohesion of Board members;

● a better understanding of the Renault Group's activities and a strengthening of the dialogue between Directors outside of Board meetings thanks notably to the site visits;

● a trust-based relationship between the Board and the Executive Management;

● the time dedicated to dealing with material matters during the Committee's meeting;

This evaluation identified recommendations and areas for improvement, such as:

● a deeper information on the market evolution and the competitive environment as well as an in-depth analysis of the Group's main competitors strategy;

● a better understanding of opportunities and risks analysis at Board meeting;

● a strengthening of the balance of skills on the Board by seeking profiles with CSR/sustainability, new mobility and new technologies and software expertises;

● the wish to spend more time on certain specific substantive and strategic matters.

3.1.8 Implementation of the “comply or explain” rule

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code, the Company refers to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, and follow its recommendations.

Pursuant to the “comply or explain” rule in Article 28.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code, the recommendations of that Code that have not been followed and the related explanations are summarized in the table below:

Recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF

Code (December 2022 version)

Proportion ofindependent directors on the Audit Committee (art. 17.1) The AFEP-MEDEF Code provides that “at least two thirds of the members of the Audit Committee must be independent directors and the Committee must not include any executive officers”.

Comments

03

As of December 31, 2022, the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee had six members,

including three independent directors, one director representing the French State, one

director representing Nissan and one director representing employee shareholders,

meaning that 60% of members were independent directors, which is lower than the rate of

two thirds required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.

Directorindependence criteria (Article 10.5) At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors examined the situation of Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, given his capacity as director of Nissan and Chairman of Renault s.a.s. for the period from October 11, 2019,to June 30, 2020.

The Board of Directors considers this composition to be balanced, given the decision to maintain a limited number of members with the presence of representatives of the reference shareholders and employees, while still supporting effective Committee work, which requires a level of financial and accounting expertise.

The AFEP-MEDEF Code states that one of the criteria that the Board of Directors must assess to possibly exclude someone from the status of independent director is that of “not being or not having been, during the past five years, an employee, executive offer, or director of a company that the company consolidates.” According to the AFEP-MEDEF Code implementation guide, this recommendation also applies when a director holds “an office in a company in which the first company holds a non-controlling but significant stake, orin a sister company”.

It is recalled that Nissan is not a company fully consolidated by Renault. Renault has significant influence over Nissan and therefore accounts for its interest in Nissan using the equity method (for more details on Renault's shareholding in Nissan, see note 12 in chapter 5.2.2.6 of the Universalregistration document).

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, with a view to developing and strengthening cooperation between the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as call

to into question Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard's freedom of judgement and independence with respectto Renault.

Furthermore, should such a situation give rise to any conflict of interest, the provisions of the Board Charter requiring the director in question to abstain from participating in the deliberations and votes ofthe Board of Directors would apply.

In addition, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Committee, considered that the performance by Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard of the duties of Chairman of Renault s.a.s. from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020, was of an exceptional and purely temporary nature, during the time required for the Board of Directors to conduct the succession process for the Chief Executive Officer and until the arrival of Mr. Luca de Meo on July 1, 2020. The Board of Directors therefore considered that this exceptional situation was not such as to call into question the independence of Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard atthe end ofthis temporary term of office.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors also reviewed Mr. Pierre Fleuriot’s situation with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code in view of his appointment as director of Nissan.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that the appointment of the Lead Independent Director of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, with a view to developing and strengthening cooperation between the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Pierre Fleuriot’s freedom of judgment and independence with respect to Renault.

Furthermore, should such a situation give rise to any conflict of interest, the provisions of the Board Charter requiring the director in question to abstain from participating in the deliberations and votes ofthe Board of Directors would apply.

3.1.9 Assessment procedure for current agreements concluded under arm’s length terms

During its meeting of February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, adopted an

internal procedure on the qualification of agreements entered into by the Company and allowing it to assess the agreements covering current operations concluded under arm’s length conditions, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-39 of the French Commercial Code (resulting from law No. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019).

The internal procedure approved by Renault’s Board of Directors describes the methodology used to qualify the different agreements to which Renault SA is a party as related-party agreements or current agreements. It also recalls the legal related-party control procedures.

This internal procedure is assessed on an annual basis by the Company’s Board of Directors, after having been

reviewed by

the Governance

and Compensation Committee, in order, notably, to take into account any legislative or regulatory amendments, changes in best practices and any implementation difficulties during the financial year.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors examined the internal procedure for evaluating current agreements concluded under arm's length conditions and, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, concluded that this procedure complies the

with legal provisions and that no modification was necessary.

3.1.10 Procedures for shareholders’ participation in the Annual General Meeting

Article 21 of the Company’s articles of association specifies the procedures for shareholders’ participation in the Annual General Meeting. These procedures are set out in chapter 6, entitled “Renault and its shareholders” (see chapter 6.1.2.2 of the Universal registration document).

3.1.11 Factors likely to have an effect in the event of a public offer

Factors that are likely to have an effect in the event of a public offer as defined by Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code are detailed in chapter 6.2.6.2 of the Universal registration document.

3.1.12 Summary table of ongoing delegations in respect of capital increases

The summary table of ongoing delegations authorized by the Annual General Meeting of the Company to the Board of Directors with respect to capital increases is presented in chapter 6.2.4.2 of the Universal registration document.

3.2.1 General principles relating to the compensation ofthe corporate officers

Once a year, as recommended by the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors sets the components of the compensation awarded to the corporate officers.

charter. In its recommendations, the Governance and Compensation Committee takes into account the balance of the different components of the corporate officers’ compensation.

The Company’s

compensation policy

is regularly reviewed at

meetings

of the Governance

and Compensation Committee, which is composed mainly of Independent Directors and chaired by an Independent Director in accordance with

the

Board of Directors’

The compensation policy for the non-executive corporate officer is based on a fixed compensation and does not include any variable or exceptional cash compensation, nor compensation for directorship.

The compensation policy for the executive corporate officer is based on six simple, stable, transparent practices:

1. Closely linked to the Company’s strategy

2. Performance-oriented

3. Focus on long-term performance

4. Close alignment with shareholders

5. Competitive compensation

6. Compensation which does not encourage excessive risk-taking

● The compensation is closely linked to the implementation and results of the strategy.

● The variable component of the executive officer’s compensation represents a fraction of the total compensation that is consistent with market practice and ensures the interests of the executive officer are aligned with the Company’s performance.

● A significant part of the executive officers’ compensation depends on multi-year targets being achieved.

● The number of performance shares allocated to the executive officer is expressed as an absolute number, rather than a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price affect the corresponding total value.

● The executive officer must retain 25% of the shares vested pursuant to performance share plans until the end of his term of office.

● Competition between corporate officers in the automotive market is intense. It is therefore of prime importance to ensure that the overall compensation of the executive officer is competitive compared to the practices of comparable companies in the Automotive sector in Europe and worldwide.

● The setting of performance targets, a sufficiently long evaluation period, and compensation capping allow excessive short-term risk-taking to be avoided.

These principles are established in compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code to which the Company refers pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22- 10-10 ofthe French Commercial Code.

More generally, the Governance and Compensation Committee regularly ensures that corporate officers’ compensation complies with all applicable laws and recommendations in terms of corporate governance.

Corporate governance

In addition, the Committee takes into account market best practices regarding the compensation of executive corporate officers:

Best practices that we follow:

320 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

● Use appropriate peer groups (country based and sector based) ● Pay for failure: pay variable components in the event of poor performance ofthe Group

to inform (but not dictate) compensation policy

● Only make modifications to performance criteria when there are material changes to our business strategy and in order to maintain the alignment with shareholders’ interests

● Clear mention of a cap for all variable elements

● Set demanding performance conditions

● Include ESG criteria that are significant for the Company’s performance and aligned with the corporate strategy

● Have a long-term performance criterion linked to shareholder return

● Subject long-term compensation plans to minimum three-year vesting conditions

● Implement post-mandate vesting policy for long-term incentives

● Engage and meetregularly with our shareholders and investors

● A Governance and Compensation Committee comprised of a majority ofindependent Board members

To evaluate the corporate officers’ compensation in light of market practices with a view

to ensure the competitiveness of the compensation, the Governance and Compensation Committee, assisted by a firm of specialized consultants,

annually

the examines

components of compensation due or awarded

by comparable companies to their corporate officers. This analysis is based on the practices of comparable

multinational organizations in the Automotive sector (Stellantis, General Motors, Ford, Honda, Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo and Toyota).

The Governance and Compensation Committee also takes into account the expectations voiced by Renault’s shareholders by way of regular meetings.

Compensation structure for the executive corporate officer

The compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer consists of:

● a fixed portion, corresponding to a fixed compensation in determined cash the

in line with role, level of responsibility, and experience of the executive corporate officer;

● a portion subject to performance conditions, comprising two distinct sub-components:

● annual variable compensation: this aims to ensure that part of the compensation of the executive corporate officer depends on the Company’s main

Practices we do not follow:

● Place a

disproportionate weight on short-term variable compensation versus long-term variable compensation

● Overly weight qualitative criteria compensation

in

the annual

variable

● Reward excessive or inappropriate risk-taking

● Have extraordinary severance payments in addition to the two- year non-compete indemnity

● Provide excessive severance or sign-on arrangements to our executives

operational, financial, and managerial objectives being achieved during the year;

● long-term compensation:

this

consists of

performance shares, designed to strengthen the alignment of the interests of the executive corporate officer with those of shareholders by making their vesting subject to the achievement of performance criteria assessed over a period of three years. In addition to the performance criteria, the vesting of shares is subject to a presence condition of three years following the allocation of the performance shares;

● a co-investment plan based on voluntary investment in Renault shares, with the benefit of a matching contribution of maximum 100% in

the form performance shares, the acquisition of which is subject to the achievement of performance criteria assessed over a cumulative period of 3 years and a 3-year presence condition.

of

In addition, the Chief Executive Officer may benefit from top-up pension schemes, a termination benefit in the event of dismissal, a non-compete agreement as well as benefits in kind that are customary for this type of position (company cars, health and life insurance schemes, etc.).

Pursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recommendations of the French Financial Market Authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers, AMF), the Chief Executive Officer does not hold an employment contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Assessment ofthe achievement ofthe performance criteria

1. Financial criteria (Quantifiable)

90% (out of a maximum of 90%) of the financial criteria were met, according to the following breakdown:

● Group operating margin (Group OM) criterion : 22.5% (out of a maximum of 22.5%)

Group OM was 4% in the 2022 budget and amounted to 5.6% for 2022.

● Free cash flow (FCF) criterion22.5% % (out of a maximum of 22.5% %)

FCF was €1,000 million in the 2022 and amounted to €2,119 million as of December 31st, 2022.

● Return on capital employed (ROCE) criterion : 22.5% (out of a maximum of 22.5%)

ROCE was 5.3% in the 2022 budget and amounted to 12.6% for 2022.

● Fixed cost (FC) criterion: 22.5% (out of a maximum of 22.5%)

Fixed Costs in 2022 were 9.9% below the target set in the 2022 budget.

2. Strategic and sustainability criteria

60% (out of a maximum of 60%) of the strategic and sustainability criteria were met, according to the following breakdown:

a) Strategy: 10% (out of a maximum of 10%)

The four indicators related to this performance criterion refer to qualitative targets.

Upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted that the four indicators have been met or exceeded.

● Successful launch of Megane E-Tech Electric:

Successful launch of the Megane E-tech with quality at the expected level after 6 months, which is the best result compared to the last launches of the Group.

● Level of invoicing within the Alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi:

Given the important role of the Alliance in Renault's strategy, the level of invoicing within the Alliance amongst Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi has been

chosen as a performance indicator. This indicator corresponds to the proportion of invoicing in relation to revenues. This percentage is set by the Alliance's exchange committees.

In 2022, Renault's invoicing targets with the Alliance were exceeded.

● Alignment of the 2026+ product line-up with the Group's 2030 ambitions:

The internal milestones for the development of the product range to achieve the Group's 2030 objectives ("Line-up 26+") have been passed in accordance with the expected schedule. This Line-up 26+ was presented at the Capital Market Day on November 8, 2022.

● Completion of the studies on the opportunity to bring together, on the one hand, Renault’s 100% electric activities and technologies and, on the other hand, its activities and technologies of ICE and hybrid engines and transmissions:

The studies carried out led to the announcements at the Capital Market Day on November 8th, 2022 presenting Renault Group's ambition to become a “Next Gen” automotive group by relying on 5 businesses focused on the new value chains, with in particular (i) the creation of Ampere, the first EV and software pure player, and (ii) the creation of Horse, a leading global Tier 1 supplier of ICE and hybrid powertrain technologies.

b) Sustainability: 40% (out of a maximum of 40%)

The first three indicators of this performance criterion refer to quantitative targets and the last indicator is qualitative.

03

Upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted that these four indicators were met or exceeded.

● Health and safety (accident frequency rate):

In 2022, the target was to reduce the FR2 rate (frequency rate of work-related accidents with lost time for Renault employees and temporary workers) to 1.4%. This level has been achieved.

● Launch of the "ReKnow" University (target of 3,000 people trained in 2022):

7,659 people trained in the ReKnow University in 2022.

● Target of 30,000 used vehicles refurbished in Flins in 2022:

30,684 vehicles were refurbished in Flins in 2022.

● Development of the circular economy business:

On October 13th, 2022, Renault Group announced the creation of THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL, the first company operating across the entire automotive circular economy value chain, aiming at moving the automotive industry towards resource neutrality. Bringing together all the existing expertise of the Group and its partners in this activity, this new entity offers closed-loop recycling solutions at each stage of a vehicle's life: supply of parts and raw materials, production, use and end of life.

c) Customer satisfaction / Quality: 10% (out of a maximum of 10%)

The three indicators of this performance criterion refer to qualitatve targets.

Upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted that these three indicators were met or exceeded.

● Reduction of the incident rate (number of incidents on vehicles under warranty after 3 months on the road)

This indicator, called the "GMF 3MIS WORLD", measures the number of incidents on vehicles after three months on the road. The objective of reducing this rate was achieved, with a 15.6% reduction compared to the previous year, for a reduction target of 12.5%.

The level reached in 2022 is historic for the Group thanks to significant progress on the vehicles produced in series and a launch at the highest level for Megane E-tech Electric.

● In 2022, the level of customer satisfaction is measured by the "dealer e- reputation" indicator, i.e. the reputation of dealers on the internet. The target for this indicator was a significant improvement in 26 out of 35 countries. This target was achieved.

Customer satisfaction level

● Launch of the "Safety Coach" program:

The "Safety Coach" is a system combining driver detection and guidance features for safer driving. Integration of the Safety Coach in new Renault Group vehicles is part of the "Safety" pillar of the Group's ESG strategy.

The Safety Coach has been integrated into Megane E-Tech Electric launched in 2022.

Accordingly, the Board of Directors noted that the total achievement rate of the performance criteria was 150% for the 2022 financial year and consequently decided to set Mr. Luca de Meo's variable compensation for that financial year at a gross amount of €1,950,000.

The Board of Directors of May 25, 2022, allocated 75,000 performance shares in respect of the 2021 financial year to the Chief Executive Officer, in accordance with the compensation policy approved by the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022.

This allocation of performance shares to the Chief Executive Officer represented 0.0254% of Renault SA’s share capital.

Out of these 75,000 performance shares, the number of shares definitively vested will depend on achievement of the following performance criteria:

● total shareholder return (TSR), for 25% maximum;

● free cash flow (FCF), for 25% maximum;

● annual increase in the net revenue per vehicle, for 25% maximum; and

● sales mix of electrified passenger cars in Europe, for 25% maximum.

These performance criteria will be measured over a cumulative three-year period (2022, 2023 and 2024).

On December 2nd, 2022, the Chief Executive Officer invested €298,004.24 under the 2022 co-investment plan by purchasing 8,629 Renault shares at a stock price of €34.5352.

Accordingly, and in accordance with the compensation policy approved by the Annual General Meeting of May 25th, 2022, the Board of Directors on February 15th 2023, allocated the Chief Executive Officer 8,629 performance shares under the 2022 co-investment plan ("co-investment shares").

,

This allocation of co-investment shares to the Chief Executive Officer represented 0.003% of the share capital of Renault SA.

It is recalled that, out of these 8,629 co-investment shares, the number of shares definitively acquired will depend on the achievement of the following performance criteria:

● total shareholder return (TSR), for a maximum of 20% ;

● Group's operating margin (Group OM), for a maximum of 20%;

● return on capital employed (ROCE), for a maximum of 20%;

● reduction in incident rates (GMF 3 MIS World), for a maximum of 20%; and

● CO2 emissions (Kg per vehicle produced in Europe), for a maximum of 20%.

These performance criteria will be assessed over a cumulative period of three years (2023, 2024 and 2025).

Acquisition of the co-investment shares is also subject to a condition of presence of 3 years and 3 months from the allocation date. Vested shares are subject to a holding period of at least 5 years from the implementation date of the plan.

The Chief Executive Officer, as he was not a director, did not receive any compensation in this respect. The Chief Executive Officer benefited from two company cars and one company car with driver.

He also benefited from an international healthcare coverage, as well as the same life insurance and supplementary healthcare schemes as for employees working in France.

The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a severance payment equal to the average of the last two years’ gross fixed and variable annual compensation, payable in one instalment within six months of the departure, in the event of dismissal at the initiative of the Board of Directors and subject to the achievement of performance conditions set by the Board of Directors.

This termination benefit will not be paid in the event of dismissal for serious or

gross misconduct.

The total termination benefit and non-compete indemnity, in the event of

implementation of the non-compete agreement (see below), may not exceed two

years of annual fixed and variable compensation.

At its meeting held on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors set the performance

conditions for payment of the termination benefit. In order to receive this benefit, the

following cumulative conditions should be met over the last two financial years

precedingthe departure (only one financial year in theevent of departure during 2021):

●

a minimum total achievement rate of 80% of the performance criteria for the

annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer;

● achievement of the Group’s free cash flow target.

At its meeting held on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a non-compete agreement with Mr. Luca de Meo. The Board of Directors considered that it is in Renault’s interest to enter into this non-compete agreement which protects Renault Group’s legitimate interests, given the particularly competitive nature of the automotive market, the importance of the functions and the recognized skills of Mr. Luca de Meo in this market, the means available to him, and the sensitive information he holds and to which he can have access. Under this agreement, Mr. Luca de Meo commits, as of the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, not to engage, directly or indirectly, in an activity that competes with those of the Group, on his own behalf, on behalf of companies in the automotive design, construction and marketing sectors (mainly passenger cars and commercial vehicles), or on behalf of automotive suppliers. Application of this clause is limited to:

● a period of twelve (12) months following the date on which Mr. Luca de Meo effectively ceases to exercise his term of office;

● the countries of the European continent and Japan, as well as European and Japanese vehicle and equipment manufacturers.

As consideration for his non-compete obligation, Mr. Luca de Meo will receive from the Company, during the period of application of the agreement (twelve months) and subject to there being no breach of this agreement, gross financial compensation corresponding to one year of gross annual compensation (fixed compensation and annual variable compensation paid in cash), payable in twelve monthly instalments. The gross annual compensation used for this calculation will be the one paid during the twelve months preceding the date of termination of the corporate office.

In accordance with the recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code at the time of Mr. Luca de Meo’s departure, the Board of Directors of the Company will decide whether to apply this non-compete agreement and may unilaterally waive it.

Top-up pension scheme

During its meeting on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a top-up pension scheme for Mr. Luca de Meo.

The Board of Directors considered that implementing this scheme to the benefit of Mr. Luca de Meo allows the Company to retain and to promote the Chief Executive Officer’s loyalty.

The Chief Executive Officer's top-up pension scheme is identical to that arranged for the members of the Group Executive Committee (the so-called “Article 83” and “Article 82”).

a) Mandatory defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 83)

The contributions represent:

● 3.5% of the gross annual compensation between four and eight times the French Social Security cap (Band C), paid 2.5% by the Company and 1% by the Chief Executive Officer;

● then 8% of the gross annual compensation between eight and sixteen times the French Social Security cap (Band D), paid 5% by the Company and 3% by the Chief Executive Officer.

The total amount of the contributions (both Company’s and officer’s share) is capped at a lump sum equal to 8% of eight times the French Social Security Cap.

For the 2022 financial year, the Company's contribution amounted to €16,968.6.

b) Optional defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 82)

The Chief Executive Officer benefits from the new defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 82) which was set up from July 1, 2020 for the benefit of the corporate officers and members of the Group’s Executive Committee.

This new scheme provides for the payment by the Company to a third-party entity (an insurer) of contributions equal to 12.5% of the gross annual compensation (fixed and variable) actually received.

For the 2022 financial year, the Company's contribution to the insurer amounted to €398,125.04 for the benefit of the Chief Executive Officer.

The contributions paid in this way do not benefit from any preferential tax or social security regime. For this reason, the Chief Executive Officer receives a lump-sum indemnity equal to the amount of the contribution paid on his behalf to the insurer. Payment of this indemnity to the Chief Executive Officer is concomitant to the payment of the contribution to the insurer and amounted to €398,125.04 for the 2022 financial year.

The contributions and lump-sum indemnity amounts will be depend on the Company’s performance insofar as the calculation basis includes the variable portion of the compensation which is related to the Group’s results.

3.2.2.3. Information on the achievement rate of the performance criteria

of the long-term variable compensation of Mr Luca de Meo,

Chief Executive Officer, allocated for the 2020 financial year

It is recalled that the Board of Directors of July 29th, 2020, awarded the Chief Executive Officer 75,000 performance shares for the 2020 financial year, in accordance with the compensation policy approved by the Annual General Meeting held on June 19th , 2020.

The number of vested shares is subject to the achievement of the following performance criteria to be assessed over a cumulative period of three years (2020, 2021 and 2022):

● Total Shareholder Return (TSR), for a maximum of 20%

● Free Cash Flow (FCF), for a maximum of 30%

● Percentage of models manufactured on the Alliance platforms, for a maximum of 30%

● Total carbon footprint (reduction of the carbon footprint (CO2 emissions) for Renault Group passenger cars and light commercial vehicles registered worldwide), for a maximum of 20%.

The Board of Directors of February 17th, 2022 considered it was necessary to propose an adjustment to one of the criteria of the Chief Executive Officer's long-term variable compensation for the 2020 financial year in order to take into account the impact of the Covid crisis on the implementation of compensation policies within the Renault Group.

Indeed, the Board considered that, in the absence of any adjustment, the exceptional situation of the 2020 financial year would result in the loss of all rights under the Free Cash Flow criterion all the three of

over years performance, which 30% of the Chief represents

Executive Officer's long-term variable compensation.

As a result, and upon the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors has exceptionally decided to neutralize the 2020 financial year in the calculation of the FCF criterion assessed over three years and, in return, to reduce the number of share rights pursuant to this criterion by one third in the 2020 performance share plan benefiting the Chief Executive Officer.

The Annual General Meeting held on May 25th, 2022, approved this amendment to the Chief Executive Officer's long-term variable compensation for the financial year 2020. Therefore, the calculation of the FCF criterion for the Chief Executive Officer's 2020 performance share plan relates only to the years 2021 and 2022 and the number of performance shares in the course of vesting has been reduced by 10% (i.e. 1/3 of the 30% weighting of this criterion)to a maximum of 67,500 shares.

On February 15th, 2023, upon the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted the following achievement rates for the performance criteria of the performance shares granted to the CEO for 2020:

Linearinterpolation if mid-term plan indicator < CMF models < mid-term plan indicator +5%.

30% The cumulative FCF over the 2021-2022 period (after neutralization of the 2020 year) amounted to EUR 4,583 million, exceeding the cumulative amount of EUR 3,144 million set in the budget over the same period.

21.67%

The target for models manufactured on Alliance platforms (CMF) for the 2020-2022 period was set at 54% in the mid-term strategic plan. This indicator reached 54.2% over this period.

Total carbon footprint 20%

● 0% if average carbon footprint < Group target

15.62%

● 14% if average carbon footprint = Group target

The target was to reduce the Group's carbon footprint of Renault Group's LCV and passenger cars registered worldwide by 25% from 2010 to 2022. At the end of December 2022, the reduction of this carbon footprint was 25.6% compared to 2010.

● 20% if average carbon footprint ≤ Group target -2.5 points.

Linearinterpolation if Group target -2.5 points

< average carbon footprint < Group target.

100%

67.29%

The noted the that total achievement rate of the performance criteria of the Chief Executive Officer's log-term variable compensation for the 2020 financial year amounted to 67.29%. Consequently, a total of 44,421 shares will vest for Mr. Luca

Board of Directors thus

de Meo on July 29th, 2023, in accordance with the provisions of the plan rules governing this performance share allocation.

As a reminder, the Chief Executive Officer is subject to an obligation to retain 25% of the vested performance shares in his capacity as executive corporate officer until the end of his term of office, in order to ensure a sufficient level of alignment of the Chief Executive Officer's interests with those of the shareholders.

3.2.3 Comparison of compensation levels between corporate officers and employees

In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code, the ratios for measuring the differences between the compensation for the Company’s corporate officers and employees are

presented in the table below.

These elements are part of the information indicated in Article L. 22-10-9 I. of the French Commercial Code and will be submitted to a general vote pursuant to I of Article L.22- 10-34 of the French Commercial Code during the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2023

Methodology for calculating the ratios

Under the terms of Article L. 22-10-9, the scope to be considered for calculating the indicators is that of the listed company issuing the corporate governance report. However, as Renault SA does not have any employees, the indicators were calculated based on the compensation of the France-based employees of five companies, all being wholly-owned subsidiaries of Renault SA. These are Renault s.a.s, Société de Transmissions Automatiques (STA), Sofrastock, RCI Banque SA and Renault Retail Group (RRG France).

Explaining the changes in the ratios for the 2022 financial year

The change in average and median employee compensation in 2022 is mainly due to the payment of higher amounts of variable and profit-sharing portions as compared to those in 2021.

The increase in the CEO's compensation in 2022 is the result of taking into account, for the first time, his variable compensation on the basis of a full financial year (i.e. his 2021 variable compensation paid in 2022).

The changes in the ratios for previous years are explained in the relevant editions of the Company's Universal Registration Document.

Thirteenth resolution – Approval of the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year

The Annual General Meeting, voting under the conditions of quorum and majority required for ordinary general meetings, having reviewed the report on corporate governance referred to in 225-37 of the Article L.

French Commercial Code describing the components of the compensation policy for the directors and corporate officers set by the Board of Directors, approves, pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, the compensation policy of the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year, as set out in chapter 3.2.4.2 of the Company’s 2022 Universal registration document.

The Chief Executive Officer's compensation is determined on consideration of the responsibilities and missions assumed and attached to his corporate office, as well as the level of his skills, his experience and his track record in this position, while taking into account the competitive environment in which the Company operates.

Thus, the Governance and Compensation Committee takes into account the median of the total compensation within the Company's main international automotive competitors (Stellantis, Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW, Volvo, Toyota, Honda, Ford and General Motors) to determine the compensation ofthe Chief Executive Officer.

The automotive and mobility industry is currently facing a profound transformation due to the emergence of new value chains such as electric vehicles (EVs), software, new mobility services and circular economy, in addition to ICE and hybrid vehicles. In this highly consolidated sector, with a global reach, there is a strong competition to attract talented executives with a strategic vision for the future of the industry and the required leadership to implement it in the long run.

The “Renaulution” strategy launched by the Chief Executive Officer, Luca de Meo, in January 2021 aims to transform the Group to benefit from the opportunities of the transformation of the automotive sector.

The deployment of “Resurrection”, the first phase of the strategic plan, which was completed 3 years ahead of schedule, is already bearing fruit with results above the

initial objectives and market expectations:

● Significant improvement in profitability: operating margin at 5.6% in 2022 versus a guidance above 5%, up €1.4 billion compared to 2021 3 (+2.8 points);

● Automotive operating margin per vehicle at a record level;

● Record free cash flow: €2.1 billion versus a guidance above €1.5 billion (+€1.2 billion compared to 2021);

● Strengthening of the financial structure: return to net cash financial position of +€549 million on December 31, 2022 (+€1.6 billion compared to 2021).

This performance is even more remarkable that the Group has faced headwinds due to the disposal of its Russian industrial activities, the semiconductor crisis and cost inflation. The Group’s fundamentals have been fully restored, as highlighted by the 2023 financial outlook.

In addition to this performance in 2022, Renault Group also announced on November 8th, 2022, the third phase of the “Renaulution” strategic plan and launched its “Revolution” with the ambition of becoming a "Next Gen" automotive company.

This third phase enables the Group to announce solid financial outlook for 2025-2030:

● Operating margin: above 8% in 2025 and above 10% in 2030; and

● Free cash flow: above €2 billion per year on average

over 2023-2025, and above €3 billion per year on average over 2026-2030.

The results presented relate to continuing operations (excluding Avtovaz and Renault Russia whose disposals were announced on May 16, 2022).

Corporate governance

This value creation is shared with all stakeholders:

● The employees :

● The "Renaulution Shareplan" employee shareholding operation enabled free allocation of 6 shares to over 95,000 employees worldwide. In addition, over 40,000 employees purchased shares with a 30% discount. The employee shareholding rate was thus increased to 4.7% of the share capital at the end of this transaction, compared with 3.79% at December 31st , 2022. A new employee shareholding plan will be implemented in 2023 in line with the ambition to reach 10% of employee shareholders by 2030.

● Renault Group also continues to share the fruits of the Group's results with its employees and to recognise collective through

performance profit-sharing agreements. In France, for example, profit-sharing amounts to 8.75% of the total wages for all employees covered by the Collective Agreement

for Metalworkers.

● In 2023, the Group is pursuing a global wage policy to support the purchasing power of all its employees, in line with the level of inflation in each country. In France, for example, the budget for overall increases in 2023 is 7.5% of total wages, including salary increases and bonuses

specific

to support purchasing power.

● The shareholders:

● The Board of Directors has proposed the payment of

a €0.25 dividend to the shareholders in 2023 in respect ofthe 2022 financial year.

● The return of dividend payment in 2023 symbolizes this new era and the payout ratio will gradually increase, in a disciplined manner, up to 35% of the Group consolidated net income – parent share, in the mid-term. To do so, the Group shall achieve its first priority, which is to return to an “investment grade” credit rating.

338 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

In view of all these elements, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, has proposed to raise 30% the

by

performance shares granted to the Chief Executive Officer and to the senior executives who contribute, by their high level of personal commitment, to the successful creation of this new organisation. This allocation will be made after confirmation of the effective implementation of the steps of the Group’s reorganisation scheduled for 2023, a source of value creation for all stakeholders. With this 30% increase in

performance shares, the total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer would remain below the median of the benchmark used by the Company.

Annualfixed compensation

The annual fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer remains unchanged since July 2020, at a gross annual amount of €1,300,000, payable in twelve monthly instalments.

Annual variable compensation

The amount of annual variable compensation may reach 150% of the fixed compensation paid if all performance criteria are The annual variable

fully achieved.

compensation will be fully paid in cash.

For the 2023 financial year, the performance criteria set by the Board of Directors include four financial criteria and three strategic and sustainability criteria. The Board of Directors considered that these are key indicators of the performance of the Renault Group and in particular in the implementation ofthe Renaulution strategic plan.

The criteria and their weighting are shown in the tables below.

Financial criteria for the 2023 financial year (0% to 90% of the fixed compensation)

The "Renaulution" strategic plan has led to a reorientation of the Renault Group's strategy by focusing on value creation rather than on volume. To ensure a close link with the Group's strategy and in line with the 2022 compensation policy, the following fourfinancial criteria are maintained:

03

● the Group Operating Margin (Group OM);

● the Free Cash Flow (FCF);

● the Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), and

● the Fixed Costs (FC).

Change of reference in the scale of payout rates

In a context of market volatility (geopolitics, raw material prices, energy prices, semiconductor crisis, logistics strains and overall cost inflation), a reference to a budget set at the beginning of the year is no longer adapted to the way business are conducted and to the need for the company to adapt quickly and agilely over the course of the year to market conditions and various contingencies. Indeed, Renault Group wants to manage its performance in a demanding manner and as closely as possible to the operational reality. To do so, it needs to rely on updated rolling forecasts throughout the year without this impacting the objectives linked to compensation. Consequently, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors decided to establish a payout scale based on threshold, upper and maximum bounds, which is consistent with market practices. The various objectives are still set in a consistent manner with both the budget and the financial outlook communicated to the market, with a level of requirement that will be assessable ex-post.

These financial criteria are all quantifiable criteria.

● 22.5% if the operating margin ● 22.5% if free cash flow is higher than the maximum

● A high level of free cash flow demonstrates the use of strict financial discipline within the Company, allowing growth to be funded and the possibility of dividend payments.

●

ROCE measures the profitability of capital invested. It reflects value creation.

● This criterion measures the reduction of the Group's fixed costs. It ensures that the Group's "break-even" point is reduced.

Strategyand sustainability criteria for the 2023 financial year (0% to 60% of the fixed compensation)

The mix of quantifiable and qualitative sustainability criteria (accidentology, circular economy, up/re-skilling) reflects the three pillars of the Group's sustainability strategy and is in line with the 2022 compensation policy. The details of this strategy are presented in Chapter 2.1.1 ofthe Company's 2022 Universal registration document.

The strategic criteria have been adapted to the challenges of the 2023 year, including the launch of “Espace”, and to the announcements of the "Revolution" phase of the strategic plan including the creation of Horse and Ampere organisations which were presented at the Capital Market Day in November 2022.

Long-term compensation

Pursuant to the Company's compensation principles, a significant portion of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation consists of long-term compensation, the vesting of which is subject to performance criteria, to ensure alignment of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation with shareholder interests.

Long-term compensation takes the form of performance shares, allocated annually. The number of performance shares allocated to is the Chief Executive

Officer expressed as an absolute number, rather than as a percentage of the salary, so that both upward and downward fluctuations in the share price will affect the total value of such long-term compensation.

The Chief Executive Officer receives performance shares under the same criteria as the other executives in the Group, subject to an additional performance criterion (Total Shareholder Return - TSR) applied to him in his capacity as executive corporate officer.

Upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of February 15th, 2023, decided that 75,000 performance shares would be allocated to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2023 financial year.

03

In addition, based on the considerations outlined in the introduction, a second allocation of 30% of performance shares may be made in 2023, once it has been established that the steps of the Group's reorganisation scheduled for 2023 have been effectively implemented. This allocation will correspond to:

● 22,500 Renault performance shares; or

● Ampere shares for a value equivalent to these 22,500 Renault shares, should Ampere be listed in 2023 and subject to the decision of the board of directors and the shareholders' meeting of Ampere.

Renault performance shares

For Renault performance shares, performance criteria will be measured over a cumulative three-year period (2023, 2024 and 2025).

Vesting of these performance shares is also subject to an over three-year presence condition starting from the date of the allocation by the Board of Directors.

The number of shares fully vested by the Chief Executive Officer out of the Renault performance shares allocated to him will depend on the achievement of the following performance criteria.

Performance criteria of the Renault performance share plan

Replacement of the free cash flow criterion by the Automotive net financial position criterion

Until now, the free cash flow was a common criterion for both the annual variable compensation and the long-term compensation in the form of performance shares. In order to meet investors' expectations, the Board of Directors decided, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, to use two distinct criteria: the free cash flow for the annual variable compensation and the Automotive net financial position for the long-term compensation. This approach provides two different but complementary ways of assessing the Group's ability to generate cash and to manage its net financial position in an agile manner over the long term.

The Automotive net financial position at the end of the year (net debt or net cash) is one of the three main criteria, together with profitability and cash generation (FCF), followed by the credit rating agencies in assessing the Company. This indicator allows the rating agencies to ascertain the Company's capacity to invest for the future and to pay dividends to shareholders.

As a reminder, the return to an "investment grade" credit rating is one of the Group's priorities and is closely linked to the dividend policy, which is to progressively increase, in a disciplined manner, the payout rate up to 35% of the Group consolidated net income – parent share, in the mid-term.

Alignment of the scale of payout rates for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) criterion to the other criteria

In order to ensure consistency between all the criteria and to maintain the incentive nature o the TSR criterion while remaining in line with the demanding practices of the market, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, decided to align the scale of payout rates for the TSR criterion with the other criteria: 0% below the benchmark, 70% at the benchmark, 100% at the benchmark +10%.

Obligation of the Chief Executive Officer to hold and retain shares vested as a result of performance share plans

The Chief Executive Officer is subject to an obligation to retain 25% of the vested performance shares in his capacity as executive corporate officer, until the end of his term of office. The aim of this requirement is to ensure

that the Chief Executive Officer’s interests are sufficiently aligned with those of shareholders.

Commitment by the Chief Executive Officer not to engage in risk hedging

Pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations, the Chief Executive Officer will commit, for each performance shares allocation, not to engage in performance share risk hedging.

Consequences of the departure of the Chief Executive Officer on the vesting of performance shares

In the event of departure from Renault Group before the end of the vesting period, the loss or retention of the performance shares allocated to the Chief Executive Officer will depend on the reason for the departure.

Departure reason Status of the performance shares not yet vested

Dismissal (occuring priorto the last day of the

vesting period)

Total loss of the rights to performance shares, in case of a dismissal for serious or

gross misconduct. Retention, in all other cases of dismissal, prorated to the vesting

period.

Resignation (occuring priorto the last day of the

vesting period)

including the performance conditions, will continue to apply.

Disability/Long-term illness Retention ofthe rights. The performance criteria are deemed to be fully met.

Death Retention of the rights to performance shares for the benefit of heirs or beneficiaries. The performance criteria are deemed to be fully met.

Exceptional circumstances

The

Board

of

Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and

Compensation Committee, may decide to exceptionally maintain the rights. The

allocation rate would be pro-rated in order to take into account the actual presence

of the Chief Executive Officer within the Group during the vesting period. There will

be no acceleration of the vesting period and the conditions of the plans, including

the performance criteria, will continue to apply.

Furthermore, there is no acceleration clause on the vesting period of the performance shares in the case of change of control.

Co-investment plan

Since 2022, the Board of Directors has supported the ambition of the Group's management to pursue a strong policy of developing employee shareholding as part of the deployment of the Renaulution strategy. This policy involves regular implementation of various employee shareholding mechanisms, such as:

● free and collective

allocations of shares, without

performance conditions,

● collective offers to purchase shares under the Group savings plan,

● annual performance share plans, subject to demanding performance conditions,

● co-investment plan in Renault shares offered to key Group managers.

Details of the employee shareholding policy are set out in chapter 3.2.5 of the Company's 2022 Universal

Registration Document.

The Chief Executive Officer will be eligible for the co- investment plan which will be offered again in 2023 to the Group's senior executives pursuant to the same terms and conditions summarized below:

● subject to voluntary investment in Renault shares up to a limit of 25% of cash compensation (annual gross fixed + variable compensation) allocated for the 2022 financial year;

● benefiting from a maximum matching contribution of 100% in the form of performance shares, the acquisition of which is subject to the achievement of performance criteria assessed over a cumulative period of 3 years (2024, 2025 and 2026) and to a condition of presence of at least 3 years from the date of allocation;

● with an obligation to retain the shares for at least a 5-year period from the date of the plan's implementation.

In preparation for the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Lead

Independent Director held a dialogue with certain investors to discuss, among other topics, the introduction of the co-investment plan in the compensation of Group executives. Following this dialogue and after having analysed the results of the votes at the last Annual General Meeting, in particular the level of shareholder support for the approval of the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2022 financial year, the Board of Directors considers that the Chief Executive

eligibility to the co-investment plan is an Officer's

essential factor of cohesion within the Group and a positive signal of confidence sent to employees and shareholders. The particularly long-term orientation of this plan, its risk dimension, the moderate impact on the CEO's total compensation, as well as the demanding

nature of the performance conditions, are in line with market expectations and best practice. The Board will continue to ensure that the evolution of the CEO's compensation is aligned with the performance of the Company and the experience of its stakeholders.

Performance criteria for the co-investment plan

The purpose of the co-investment plan is to interest the Group's senior executives in the Company's results while aligning their long-term interests with those of the shareholders. The criteria used for this plan allow for the measurement of the Company's financial and non-financial performance over the long term.

Alignment of the scale of payout rates for the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) criterion with that for the other criteria

In order to ensure consistency between all the criteria and to maintain the incentive nature of the TSR criterion while remaining in line with the demanding practices of the market, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, decided to align the scale of payout rates for the TSR criterion with that for the other criteria: 0% below the benchmark, 70% at the benchmark, 100% at the benchmark +10%.

Mr. Luca de Meo will not perceive any compensation in respect of his directorship.

Benefits of any kind

The Chief Executive Officer benefits from two company cars and one company car with driver. He also benefits from an international healthcare cover and from the same life

insurance and supplementary healthcare schemes as for the employees working in France.

Service provision agreement

No service provision agreement will be entered into between the Company and the Chief Executive Officer.

Sign-on bonus

The Chief Executive Officer does not receive any sign-on bonus.

Termination benefit

The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a severance payment equal to the average of the last two years’ gross fixed and variable annual paid compensation, payable in one instalment within six months of the departure, in the event of dismissal at the initiative of the Board of Directors and subject to the achievement of performance conditions set by the Board of Directors.

This termination benefit will not be paid in the event of dismissalfor serious or gross misconduct.

The total termination benefit

and non-compete indemnity, in the event of the implementation of the non- compete agreement (see below), may not exceed two years of annual fixed and variable compensation.

At its meeting held on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors set the performance conditions for payment of the termination benefit. In order to receive this benefit, the following cumulative conditions should be met over the lasttwo financial years preceding the departure:

●

a minimum total achievement rate of 80% of the

performance criteria for

the

annual variable

compensation of the Chief Executive Officer;

● achievement of the Group’s free cash flow target.

Non-compete indemnity

At its meeting held on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a non-compete agreement with Mr. Luca de Meo.

346

The Board of Directors considered that it is in Renault’s interest to enter into this non-compete agreement which protects Renault Group’s legitimate interests, given the particularly competitive nature of the automotive market, the importance of the functions and the recognized skills of Mr. Luca de Meo in this market, the means available to him, and the sensitive information he holds and to which he can have access.

Under this agreement, Mr. Luca de Meo commits, as of the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, not to engage, directly or indirectly, in an activity that competes with those of the Group, on his own behalf, on behalf of companies in the automotive design, construction and marketing sectors (mainly passenger cars and light commercial

vehicles), or on behalf of automotive suppliers.

Application of this clause is limited to:

●

a period of twelve (12) months following the date on which Mr. Luca de Meo effectively ceases to exercise his term of office;

● the countries of the European continent and in Japan, as well as European and Japanese car and equipment manufacturers.

As consideration for his non-compete obligation, Mr. Luca de Meo will receive from the Company, during the period of application of the agreement (twelve months) and subject to there being no breach of this agreement, gross financial compensation corresponding to one year of gross annual compensation (fixed compensation and annual variable compensation paid in cash), payable in twelve monthly instalments. annual

The gross compensation used for this calculation will be the one paid during the twelve months preceding the date of termination of the corporate office.

In accordance with the recommendation of the AFEP- MEDEF Code at the time of Mr. Luca de Meo’s departure, the Board of Directors of the Company will decide whether to apply this non-compete agreement, and may unilaterally waive it. Furthermore, no compensation will be due in the event of retirement or if Mr. Luca de Meo has reached the age of 65.

Top-up pension scheme

During its meeting on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a top-up

pension scheme for Mr. Luca de Meo.

The Board of Directors considered that implementing this scheme to the benefit of Mr. Luca de Meo allows the Company to retain and to promote the Chief Executive Officer’s loyalty.

The Chief Executive Officer’s top-up pension scheme is identical to that available to members of the Group Executive Committee (the so-called “Article 83” plan and “Article 82” plan).

3.2.4.3. Compensation policy for directors for the 2023 financial year

Resolution submitted to the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2023, pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code

Fourteenth resolution – Approval of the compensation policy for directors for the 2023 financial year

The Annual General Meeting, voting under the conditions of quorum and majority required for ordinary general meetings, having reviewed the report on corporate governance referred in

to Article L. 225-37 French Code Commercial describing the components of the compensation policy for the directors and corporate officers set by the Board of Directors, approves, pursuant to the provisions of Article L.22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code, the compensation policy for

Overall budgetfor directors’ compensation

The Annual General Meeting of June 15, 2018, set at €1,500,000 the maximum amount of compensation to be allocated among the directors (seventeenth resolution).

Allocation policy

The new policy for allocating directors’ compensation adopted by the Board of Directors for the 2023 financial year consists of setting a maximum annual amount of directors’ compensation for participation in Board of Directors’ meetings and meetings of each of the committees, which will include:

● a fixed portion, pro-rated according to the duration of the office over the year; and

● attendance rate over the total number of meetings for the year.

a variable portion, pro-rated

according to

the

The variable portion related to attendance at the meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees is preponderant compared to the fixed portion.

The advantages of this allocation policy are that it will prevent the annual maximum amount for directors’ compensation from being exceeded, and there will be a strong between compensation

correlation and attendance.

The following table sets out the rules for calculating directors’ compensation:

It is reminded that the Chairman of the Board of Directors does notreceive any compensation for his directorship.

The amount of compensation for each director for the 2023 financial year will be set by the Board of Directors called to approve the financial statements for the 2023 financial year.

Directors’ compensation for the 2023 financial year will be paid in one instalment in 2024.

It is specified that the three directors representing employees and the director representing employee

In its twenty-sixth resolution, the Combined General Meeting held on May 25, 2022 authorized the Board of Directors to proceed, on one or more occasions, with free allocations of existing Company shares and/or Company shares to be issued (so-called performance shares) for the benefit of members of staff and/or corporate officers of the Company and/or of French or non-French companies or groups directly or indirectly related to it, or certain categories thereof, pursuant to the terms of Article L. 225- 197-2 ofthe French Commercial Code.

Performance share plans are decided annually by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the

Governance and Compensation Committee.

In accordance with best market practices, the vesting of performance shares is subject to (i)

performance conditions set by the Board of Directors assessed over a minimum period of three years and (ii) a minimum vesting period ofthree years.

The beneficiary of performance shares must be an employee or corporate officer within Renault Group at the vesting date of the shares. In case of departure from Renault Group before the vesting date, the beneficiary loses his/her entitlement to the performance shares granted to him/her, except in the case of compulsory or voluntary early retirement.

In the event of the death, total or partial invalidity, or extended sick leave of the beneficiary, they retain the

benefit of the performance shares, and the performance conditions do not apply.

Performance share allocations granted pursuant to the aforementioned authorization are subject to the following caps being observed:

● the total number of performance shares allocated may not exceed 3% of the share capital over three years;

● the total number of performance shares allocated may not exceed 10% of the share capital on the date on which the Board of Directors decides on their allocation;

● the number of performance shares allocated to senior executive officers may not exceed 15% of the total number of shares allocated;

● the number

of performance shares allocated to members of the executive committee (also known as Leadership Team) may not exceed 30% of the total number of shares allocated, including performance shares allocated to the Chief Executive Officer.

Pursuant to the twenty-sixth resolution of the Combined General Meeting held on May 25, 2022, performance share

allocations do not result in

any dilution for the shareholders, as the performance shares allocated are treasury shares.

The authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022 to the Board of Directors to allocate performance shares will expire in 2025.

3.2.5.2. Allocation policy for the performance share plans

The Board of Directors approves the performance share plans based on the work and recommendations of the Governance and

Compensation

Committee. The committee examines the allocation proposals for certain Renault Group employees presented by the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the general scheme set by the Annual General Meeting.

The purpose of share allocations

The aim of performance share allocations is primarily to personally associate the worldwide management of Renault Group, in particular the members of management bodies, with the development of the Group’s value by allowing them to share ownership ofthe Company.

It also provides recognition of executives whose outstandingly positive action has contributed to Renault Group’s results.

Lastly, it helps to promote loyalty in executives who are of particular value to the Company, notably executives with a high potential for career development. The allocation of shares increases their commitment and motivation to implement growth in the Company.

This scheme has proved to be a factor in strengthening the role of responsibility centers throughout Renault Group worldwide, more particularly in the Automotive sector, sales subsidiaries, vehicle and mechanical engineering, bodywork and power train plant managers, industrial subsidiaries, as well as for all program managers and vehicles or components project managers. It is also applied in sales financing, as well as for the managers of large support functions in Renault Group.

Share allocation policy

Allocation is differentiated according to beneficiaries’ level of responsibility and contribution, on the basis of the appraisal of their performance and results, and according to the assessment of their development potential.

Beneficiaries are divided into three categories.

Top management As of March 1, 2023, the top management team consists of 20 members of the Leadership Team (which replaces the Board of Management and the Corporate Management Committee since February 1, 2023).

The portion of performance shares granted to the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Leadership Team (including the Chief Executive Officer) does not exceed, respectively, 15% and 30% of the performance shares granted.

Senior executives Senior executives are beneficiaries and the number of performance shares allocated vary, according to their

3.2.5.3. Employee shareholding policy

In line with the objective of significantly increasing the employee shareholding level by 2030, the Board of Directors of February 17, 2022 supported the principle of a strong policy of developing employee shareholding as part ofthe deployment ofthe Renaulution strategy.

This revival of employee shareholding within the Renault Group is included in certain resolutions submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 25, 2022. It forms part of the Renaulution plan and embodies Renault Group’s strategic and managerial commitment to give all Renault Group employees a long-term opportunity to share in the fruits of future growth, starting with the strategy’s second phase, ‘Renovation’.

It will also strengthen collective commitment, thus fuelling the success of the new strategy and aligning the long- term interests of Renault Group employees with those of shareholders, whilst also contributing to the stability of Renault shareholding.

This

policy is based on strategic

orientations:

the following

● Regular

implementation of collective employee shareholding offers, which could take the form of an offer to acquire shares under the Group Savings Plan and

the International Group Savings Plan, with employees being able to benefit from a maximum discount of 30% on the stock price and a matching contribution, in accordance with the provisions of the French Labor Code. In order to give all Group employees an opportunity to become shareholders, Renault could also make a collective free allocation of shares.

● Long-term variable compensation through annual allocation of performance shares, subject to a minimum three-year presence condition from the allocation date

level of responsibility, performance, and results. Certain senior executives may not be beneficiaries.

Other beneficiary executives

The other beneficiaries are usually senior managers and

managers with high professional or managerial development potential or with a high level of expertise. systems

There are numerous complementary for assessing and selecting these beneficiaries (level of responsibility, annual appraisal

interview, career committees, specific

monitoring

for

high potential executives, etc.);

these systems observations which help us to find the most deserving candidates.

Over the past five years, the total number of performance share beneficiaries has been:

● 1,123 under the 2018 plan,

● 1,322 under the 2019 plan,

● 1,421 under the 2020 plan,

● 2,015 under the 2021 plan, and

● 1,663 under the 2022 plan,

and demanding performance conditions, assessed over at least three consecutive financial years.

● Implementation of a co-investment plan offered to the Group's key executives, including the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Board of Management and of the Corporate Management Committee, based on each participant's voluntary, personal investment in Renault shares at risk, for a minimum period of five years, and which may give entitlement, subject to compliance with strict attendance and performance conditions, to Renault shares. This

performance

dynamic plan aims to promote the commitment of key executives to the Group's strategy.

The various mechanisms of this plan will be deployed in as many countries as possible, depending on regulatory and technical constraints, and will enable employees to acquire shares on preferential terms.

Employee share ownership operation - Renaulution Shareplan 2022

As part of its new employee shareholding policy, Renault Group launched Renaulution Shareplan 2022, an extensive employee shareholding operation deployed in 29 countries and offered to over 110,000 employees.

The offer reserved for employees was carried out within the framework of Articles L. 3332-18 et seq. of the French Labour Code, as well as the savings plans of Renault Group, DIAC and RRG. In some countries, due to local legal, tax and operational constraints, the offer was

implemented outside this legal framework.

● a free allocation

of

6 Renault shares

(offer in 29 countries), and

shares preferentialterms (offer in 21 countries).

● the possibility of purchasing Renault on

Under the subscription offer, eligible employees were offered the opportunity to subscribe shares at a 30% discount to the average of the 20 closing stock market prices preceding the date on which the subscription price was set by the CEO. The subscription price was EUR 22.02. In addition to this 30% discount, Renault Group added an additional contribution of 300%, capped at 6 free shares.

The subscription period ran from November 24 to December 12, 2022 inclusive. Delivery of the shares subscribed for under the operation took place on 7 February 2023. The shares acquired in that operation are held for 5 years (except in exceptional cases of early exit) through a company mutual fund (FCPE) or in some countries directly in a registered account.

Renaulution Shareplan 2022 was a great success with Group employees: 95,396 employees benefited from the free allocation of 6 shares and 40,307 subscriptions were recorded, representing a subscription rate of over 36% at Group level.

The contributions offered by Renault Group in the context of the operation (unilateral matching additional contribution equivalent 6

to shares and matching contribution of 300% capped at 6 shares) amounted to more than €25,565,000.

The total investment by employees was more than €41,520,000, for an average subscription amount per employee of €1,160.

The success of the

Renaulution Shareplan 2022 demonstrates the strong commitment of the Group's employees and their confidence in its strategic direction. It is a further important step in the Group's ambition to reach 10% employee share ownership by 2030.

2022 co-investment operation

In line with its employee share ownership policy, a co-

investment plan was offered to

members of the Leadership Team (including the CEO) and to nearly 450 key executives of the Renault Group.

The operation was based on a voluntary, personal and risky investment in Renault shares by each participant for a minimum period of five years and gave the right to a matching contribution in the form of a free allocation of Renault performance shares.

Vesting of the performance shares allocated under this operation will take place at the end of a three-year vesting period and subject to fulfillment of strict presence and performance conditions. Once vested, the shares will be subject to a two-year holding period.

With a 60% participation and nearly €7,000,000 invested in Renault shares, the co-investment operation was very well received by eligible employees. On February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors allocated 199,660 performance shares to the 280 participants in the co-investment plan (excluding the CEO).

The success of this co-investment operation shows the strong commitment of Renault Group's key executives who, through their voluntary investment from their own funds, reiterate their trust in the Group's strategy and their commitment to achieving the Group's growth objectives.

Renault Group Risk and control

4.1Control and risk management system

Renault Group has adopted organizational structures and procedures to contain the risks inherent in its activities and to limit their negative impact. The risk management and internal control processes are implemented in all corporate functions and activities. The main objectives are:

● identify and manage risks to which the company is exposed;

● ensure compliance with rules, laws and regulations;

● control quality, cost and delivery times in its activities;

● ensure that financial, accounting and management disclosures are reliable, relevant and of a high standard.

These structures and procedures cannot, however, offer an absolute guarantee that the company’s objectives will be achieved. In order to mediate between the opportunities and risks, Renault Group’s global risk management system aims to reduce the impact and/or probability of events that may have a significant influence on the control of operations or the fulfilment of objectives. The internal control and risk

management systems identify and assess risks by measuring the level of risk factor control and the efficacy of management plans.

The Group comprises the following operating segments: Renault Group's Automotive Division, Mobility Services, which include activities related to new forms of mobility (mainly the holding company Renault MAI and its subsidiaries) and sales financing, Mobilize Financial Services - Mobilize F.S. (trademark of RCI Banque S.A.).

Since 2007, Renault Group has taken into account the reference framework and implementation guidelines of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which were updated in July 2010, and the recommendations of the Audit Committee working group report published in July 2010. This framework applies to the Automotive and Mobility Services segments.

Sales financing, Mobilize Financial Services (Mobilize F.S.), has defined its own internal control and risk management framework, which is described in chapter 4.1.6. - The specificities of Mobilize Financial Services, in accordance with banking and financial regulations. Mobilize F.S. is subject to controls by the French Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR) and the European Central Bank (ECB).

4.1.1 Contributors to risk management

Since 2021, Renault Group’s Automotive Division has been structured around two main components:

● the “Business Units” for each brand are responsible for margins and customer satisfaction. They drive the organization towards targeted customers and markets;

358

● the “Corporate Functions” include all other business lines of the company. They define the policies and provide standards, methods and skills appropriate to the activities. First, engineering is directly linked to the brands and bears full responsibility for the timing, costs and performance of product development.

Structuring around three lines of control

In accordance with the general principles of internal control defined by the AMF and in compliance with the principle of segregation of duties, Renault Group’s internal control and risk management system is structured around the concept of the three lines of control described below :

Audit and Risks Committee (CAR)

Board of Management (BOM)

Risks and Internal Control Committee (CRCI)

Ethics and Compliance Committee (CEC)

1st line

2nd line

3rd line

Internal Audit

Operational Management

Global functions

• Risk Management

• Functions • Project

• Internal Control Ethics/Compliance

• Country

• Management Control

• Accounting

• Quality • HR

• Legal Environment, etc. •

Firstline of control:

Operational Management

Operational management, the first line of control, applies and deploys in its area of responsibility the principles and techniques of internal control and risk management defined at the Group level. Operational management is responsible for identifying the risks associated with each activity and implementing actions to reduce their impact.

Employees are therefore required to comply with the internal control system defined for their field of activity, the Group’s code of ethics, the guide for preventing corruption and influence peddling, as well as their own dedicated codes of ethics. Operational management is responsible in particular for defining and monitoring the implementation of action plans following assignments conducted by the Internal Audit Department.

Second line of control: Risk Management, Internal Control, Performance and Control

Beyond their role as the first line of control via their employees and managers, the “Corporate” Functions also

contribute as a second

line of control, as their

managementis responsible for:

● establishing and circulating standards, reference texts and Group policies;

● regulatory monitoring;

● forming and coordinating an internal and external network of correspondents;

● ensuring that their policies and standards are properly understood and applied;

● performing controls, when necessary, within the operational entities to check that they are being implemented.

They are supported in this process by:

● the Internal Control

Department, provides reasonable assurance on the level of internal control by assessing its maturity and effectiveness. For this purpose, it circulates self-assessment questionnaires and carries out compliance tests. It also ensures that action plans are identified and implemented to correct the shortcomings identified;

which

● the Risk Management Department, which is responsible for updating the mapping of the Group’s major risks and monitoring action plans designed to reduce the impact or probability of the main risks identified and for providing support for the risk mapping of operating entities, corporate functions and projects;

● the Group Performance and Control Department, with its representatives in the entities, which coordinates and steers the process in the field. It ensures that all personnel comply with management rules and assists operational staff in the coordination and monitoring of their action plans.

Third line of control: Internal Audit Department

The Internal Audit Department conducts an independent and objective assessment of the corporate governance, risk management and control processes as defined within the Group. The mission, role, responsibilities and scope of the Internal Audit Department are laid down in an audit charter, the updated version of which was approved by the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR) in September 2022. Through its recommendations, Internal Audit to the

contributes improvement of operational security and the optimization of the overall performance of the company. At the end of each assignment, Internal Audit issues a final report and summary note, which are systematically distributed to the auditees, the functions/entities/projects concerned, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chairman. The summary report includes an opinion issued by the internal audit department, which is intended to give an overall assessment of the level of control of the audited activities: risk under

control (green), moderate risk (yellow), significant risk (orange), major risk (red).

The Internal Audit Department covers all entities and activities of Renault Group’s Automotive branch and Mobility Services.

The finance branch (Mobilize Financial Services) has its own internal audit structure (see chapter 4.1.6.). The Internal Audit Department may also audit the functions converged with Nissan. For entities in partnership with Renault Group, the intervention of the internal audit can be done after agreement of the partner. For activities entrusted to third parties, the intervention of internal audit is possible if the audit clause in the contract so provides.

Risk and control

The audit plan is made on an annual basis and covers a rolling three-year period. It is verified by Senior Management and approved by the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR). This audit plan is revised as necessary to take into account additional requests or adjustments required.

Internal Audit assignments make it possible to:

● assess the compliance of processes and their application with the rules, standards,laws and regulations in force;

● assess

the effectiveness of processes

and the

performance of transactions;

● verify the quality of the controls performed by the operational departments and the support and control functions;

● suggest areas for improvement or progress in the form ofrecommendations;

● fight against fraud and corruption;

● verify the effective implementation of the recommendations.

Following the recommendations made in each audit report, an action plan defined by the auditees is validated by the internal audit. There are three levels of criticality for recommendations

the (high, medium, low, identified respectively as A, B and C). The Internal Audit Department

ensures that the recommendations are implemented. At least every six months, it prepares a status report on A and B recommendations for

the Leadership Team (formerly BOM) and the CAR.

The Internal Audit department is certified by the French Institute of Audit and Internal Control

(IFACI)1 .

This

certification, in accordance with the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing (référentiel professionnel de l’audit interne – RAI), comprises 25 general requirements divided into 100 detailed requirements across five categories: positioning, steering, audit processes, GRC (governance, risks and compliance) assessment program and professionalism.

Synchronization of activities

In order to have a shared vision of the Group’s risks and priority issues, to define a consistent approach, and to have effective follow-up between the second (Risk Management, Internal Control and Performance and Control Department) and third (Internal Audit) lines of control, the Risk Management, Internal Control and Internal Audit departments regularly work together closely. They synchronize their activities and ensure that their

combined actions provide reasonable control of risks.

These actions were reinforced since 2021 with, for example, the systematic integration of the findings of internal audits and the annual internal control campaign into the risk management of the Group, operational entities, corporate functions and projects. Improvements to this synchronization were shared with the CAR.

A joint mid-term Risk Management, Internal Control, Internal Audit and Quality Department project was initiated at the end of 2022 with the aim of acquiring a common tool with the best market standards in order to strengthen and optimise risk management within the Group.

4.1.2 Governance of risk management

The first two lines of control report on risk management and internal control to the Risk and Internal Control Committee (CRCI), which is also responsible for validating and regularly assessing the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems.

This committee, chaired by the CFO of the Group, consists of 20 members representing the various corporate functions of the company. It meets six times a year and examines, in particular:

● the mapping of the Group’s major risks and, in each of these areas, the monitoring of treatment actions; ● the results of the annual internal control self- assessments

conducted by

the Internal Control Department and the monitoring of the associated action plans;

● proposals for improving the systems.

Following this review, the CRCI may decide on corrective actions or request additional information.

The first two lines of control also report to the Board of Management (BOM) on an ad hoc basis through thematic presentations.

The second and third lines of control present the results of their work to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR), whose duties are defined in chapter 3.1.6.1.

In the course of their duties, the statutory auditors assess the level of risk management and internal control of the preparation and processing of accounting and financial data

as required and, when issue

necessary,

recommendations.

In the operational entities, functions and projects, the management committee meets regularly to, on the model of the Group CRCI, validate and assess the effectiveness of the control and risk management systems.

4.1.3 Risk management system

04

The Group applies a risk management method based, on the one hand, on the identification and assessment of risks of all kinds, resulting in a risk map, and on the other hand, on the implementation of action plans to deal with these risks, in particular their impact and/or probability of elimination, or prevention,

occurrence: protection transfer. The identification of risks is based on evaluations of the residual impact and probability of occurrence (after taking into account the treatment plans), the product of which is criticality. This method is applied at Group level, at entity level, at global function level and at vehicle project level. The mapping of the Group's major risks (top-down and bottom-up approaches) is presented to the CRCI, Leadership Team and CAR, which validate it.

The major risk factors to which the Group is exposed are described in chapter 4.2.

To carry out its duties, the Risk Management Department (DMR) relies, in particular, on two networks:

●

one comprising correspondents mainly from the performance and control function for the operating entities (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries) and the corporate functions, and from the quality assurance function for new vehicle projects. These correspondents are known as Operational Risk Managers (RMO). They work with the Risk Management Department on the operational implementation of risk management processes within the entities, corporate functions and projects;

● the other made up of experts who manage a specific area of risks. These may be risks common to all companies or specific to one of Renault Group’s segments of activity. These experts are known as Expert Risk Managers (RME) and consult on the standardized risk management plans in their area of expertise.

To draw up the audit plan for the company’s major risks, which is validated by Senior Management and approved

4.1.4 Internal control

The internal control system is based on the various guidelines and tools detailed below.

Group ethics and corporate function guidelines

The “Corporate Functions” define and issue the policies and standards to be deployed, which are then rolled out as procedures and operating methods to ensure that processes at the operational level function in accordance with the principles outlined in the Group’s code of ethics, the guide for preventing corruption and influence peddling, and the dedicated codes of ethics.

by the CAR, the Internal Audit Department uses risks map to identify the most pertinent audit themes and assess risk coverage. Through its auditing task, the Internal Audit Department provides the Risk Management Department with insight on the effective level of control of major risks.

The risk management policy is applied at Group level for major risks. It is rolled out at the operating entity level (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries), for Corporate Functions and for new vehicle projects.

In 2022, the Risk Management Department focused its activities on:

● updating the mapping of the Group's major risks. This exercise took a top-down approach that involved the Group's 70 main executives, complemented by a bottom- up approach based on the analysis of the risk maps of the entities, corporate functions and new vehicle projects performed at the end of 2021 and in 2022;

● consolidating

treatment plans and processes improve the control of the major risks;

to

● reinforcing the governance of major risks through regular sharing with the BOM and the CAR;

● assisting the operational entities, corporate functions and new vehicle projects for the implementation of risk maps produced with the operational risk managers concerned and for the monitoring of treatment plans;

● leading the network of operational risk managers and experts and the representatives of the performance and control, internal control and internal audit functions in sharing best practices.

In addition,

awareness-raising

actions for Group employees about risk culture and the fundamentals of risk management were continued by the Risk Management Department (communication and training, in particular through e-learning modules).

The Internal

Control

Department manages internal issues within

control the business lines through a

methodology that aims, in particular, to:

● work with the business lines to identify the main risks relating to operational processes and likely to have a significant impact on the achievement of objectives;

● formalize the “metarules” to be applied in the activities;

● identify and formalize the key controls aimed at controlling the identified risks.

The Risk and Internal Control Committee validates the metarules and key controls managed by the business lines, which are then included in the internal control self- assessment questionnaire.

Renault Group Risk and control

The Internal Control Department thus defined a reference system for internal control structured around some thirty points, known as "risk control factors", and

key

comprising around 200 control points.

These elements are made available to all the Group's employees in an internal control e-book, a digital document that brings together the essentials of internal control. It provides an overview of the internal control system and is an entry point to the various business sites.

This internal control reference document is updated every year to take into account the evolution of identified risks and organizational changes. Recommendations made following internal audits or by the statutory auditors are taken into account during this update.

The Internal Control Department relies on a network of internal control correspondents who are affiliated with the Performance and Control function of the subsidiaries and corporate functions and are the key contacts for internal control issues. They lead and ensure the implementation of internal control objectives within their scope.

Control activity

Once a year,

an

internal

control self-assessment campaign (questionnaires forms) based on these risk control factors is sent to the Group’s main entities by the Internal Control Department. The CEOs of the entities validate these self-assessments and commit to defining and implementing action plans to remedy any internal control shortcomings identified. These action plans are subject to regular monitoring by the Internal Control Department.

The results of these self-assessments are presented to the Risk and Internal Control Committee (CRCI) and the CAR once a year.

Compliance tests are conducted based on a sample of entities by the internal controllers of the Internal Control Department to verify the quality of the self-assessments. Any significant deviation from the expectations of the reference document gives rise to an action plan. This internal control system applies to the parent company and all significant entities, fully consolidated companies in particular.

Entities with lower

risk levels (entities

not fully consolidated or unconsolidated entities) are subject to separate control

internal systems. Newly acquired companies are consolidated according to their potential risk impact in the various internal control systems, during the first campaign following their integration. In the first year of self-assessment, the results are not consolidated with the Group results, as the focus is on the action plans.

362 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

The work of the Internal Control Department in 2022 included:

● continued action to improve the corruption prevention system and support for the operational staff concerned;

● updating of the "risk control factors" taken into account for the 2022 self-assessment campaign;

● the creation and deployment of a series of e-learning modules for internal control training;

● seven e-learning modules implemented (Introduction to Internal Control, Corporate Governance, Business Process Control, Delegation Of Authority (DOA), Internal Control System, Segregation of Duties and Fraud) in addition to traditional face-to-face training;

● the organization by

the Internal

Group Control department of quarterly webinars dedicated to leading the network of internal controllers;

● the continuation of preventive and detection controls based on a Data Analytics process.

The "tone at the top" in terms of internal control was reaffirmed by the circulation of an editorial written by the CFO in the introduction to the annual self-assessment questionnaire, but also on the occasion of the release of the internal control e-book, the distribution of which was supported by editorials written by the CEO and the CFO of the Group.

These internal control communication and coordination activities will be continued in 2023 in the context of the new organization. Governance and consideration of the internal control expectations in the new companies will be given priority in 2023.

Internal delegations and separation of offices

In addition to command-line structures, the Group has set up a staff reporting system so that corporate function managers can provide leadership for their function correspondents throughout the Group.

The decision-making process is based on a system of internal delegation that determines in which areas and at which levels operational managers may make decisions. All the rules for delegating decision-making authority are communicated to personnel via the intranet. Decision requests are tracked in a workflow that implements the rules specifying the persons to be involved, in accordance with internal control procedures or documented in the minutes of the committees responsible for making the decision.

The principle of segregation of duties and tasks is required at all hierarchical and functional levels within the Group and within the computer systems to facilitate independent control and to separate tasks and functions corresponding to operations, the protection of property and their booking for accounting purposes.

Senior Management communicates Renault Group’s general objectives as part of the multi-year plan and annual budgets, as well as the allocation of resources to the operating Group

segments, brands and functions. Management Control develops performance guidelines for each of the operating segments, brands and functions. These include the macroeconomic assumptions to be taken into account (exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, commodity prices, etc.), the financial and non- financial indicators to be measured in the following year, the timing and the segmentation of the scope of activity. Each brand is responsible for transmitting its instructions to the subsidiaries within its scope after having completed them with the specificities of the function.

The performance and control function is responsible for managing and measuring economic performance at the various levels of the organization (group, operating

segments, brands, functions).

Management control is carried out in a decentralized manner in order to take into account the specific aspects of each function. A framework is provided for its duties, in particular, by the periodic instructions provided by the Group Performance and Control Department.

Underthe Group’s management plan, its role is to:

● set out the Group’s economic objectives and budget;

● participate in the implementation of the internal control system and Renault Group’s risk management approach; ● coordinate the Group by measuring the performance of entities, operating segments, brands and functions and, in particular, by monitoring indicators relating to operating margin for all operating segments and free cash flow for the Automotive operating segments;

● analyze proposed management decisions at any level from an economic perspective, check their consistency with standards, plans and budgets, judge their economic relevance and give an opinion and recommendation on them.

For the preparation

of accounting

and financial information, the Group relies on management reference guidelines indicating the fundamental management principles applicable to the company.

The internal control system for accounting and financial information is based on the AMF reference framework. It covers not only the processes involved in preparing

the accounts, financial information, for closing

forecasting phases or financial communication but also

the upstream operational

producing this information.

processes

involved in

The Group has information systems that allow the simultaneous production of financial statements according to local standards and Group standards. This mechanism thus guarantees the consistency of data in a context of centralization and consolidation of information within a short time frame. Under the functional authority of the VP, Group Accounting (DCGr), responsibility for drawing up the financial statements lies with the Chief Financial Officers of the subsidiaries, who report to the Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of these same subsidiaries.

A manual defines the Group’s shared standards of presentation and valuation. This manual, which is updated year after year, is made available to all entities via the Group’s portal and ensures the consistency of the reported financial information.

Principles applied in preparing the financial statements

Renault Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB),

the adoption regulations of which were published in the Official Journal of the European Union as of the reporting date.

The Group Accounting Department, which is under the direct authority of the Group’s Chief Financial Officer, has an “Accounting Standards” unit. It has the authority to effectively enforce the application of the applicable accounting principles. Company employees are regularly informed of changes and updates to IFRS.

Renault Group, which comprises three distinct operating segments, prepares consolidated financial statements using a single consolidation tool, structured according to a single chart of accounts for all entities in the consolidation scope.

It publishes consolidated half-yearly and annual financial statements. These statements are prepared in advance on the basis of two pre-closing dates: 31 May for the June closing and 31 October 31, for the December close. Summary meetings are organized with the statutory auditors and attended by Senior Management as part of their ongoing discussions. The CAR is involved at every key stage of the approval process for financial and accounting disclosures.

Consolidated revenues are published quarterly.

Renault Group Risk and control

Key components of the process for controlling financial and accounting disclosures

Renault Group manages the decentralized operations of the subsidiaries in its three operating segments in France or abroad by relying on the following key strategies to deliver high-quality accounting and financial information while reducing the time needed to prepare the financial statements:

● standardization of operational systems upstream of accounting is systematically sought;

● deployment of the financial and accounting modules of the ERP chosen by the Group in the industrial and/or commercial, engineering and sales financing entities throughout the world.

This software package ensures that processed data are reliable and consistent. In particular, the definition and monitoring of user profiles helps to ensure that the rules of task separation are respected.

Control of basic transactions handled by operational systems, where the initial control takes place, is key to ensuring that accounting and financial data are reliable. The operational systems feed data to the auxiliary accounting systems through interfaces. These interfaces, which are continually monitored to ensure they capture all economic events for each upstream process, then rapidly and regularly send these data to the centralized accounting system.

The accounting teams have worked with IT staff to develop a security process to protect the ERP in the event of a major malfunction. A business continuity plan has been prepared at corporate level. It is deployed in those subsidiaries that use the ERP.

Statutory auditors’ charter

In connection with the statutory audit of its accounts, Renault Group took the initiative in 2004 of drafting a charter concerning the tasks and independence of the statutory auditors and signing it with them. This charter governs the relationship between Renault Group (the parent company and the French and foreign subsidiaries) and its statutory auditors. The charter was updated in 2020 as part of the renewal of the Board of Auditors in 2019 to take into account regulatory changes relating to statutory audits.

Financial communication

Renault Group has chosen to entrust all of the Group’s financial communication

to the Investor Relations Department within the Finance Department and to provide it with the functions necessary to accomplish this mission.

The Investor Relations Department is responsible for:

● communication with the financial markets;

● relations with investors and individual shareholders;

● relations with financial rating agencies;

● relations with analysts and investors specialized in socially responsible investments;

● relations with the regulatory authority (AMF);

● steering the preparation of the annual and half-yearly earnings reports and quarterly information;

● filing the Universal Registration Document with the AMF, produced under the responsibility of the Internal Control Department.

4.1.6 Specificities of Mobilize Financial Services

Mobilize Financial Services (Mobilize F.S.) has a global internal control system which aims to identify, analyze and manage the main risks identified in relation to the company’s objectives. The Mobilize F.S. group’s Internal Control Committee has validated the general framework for this system, which is described in the Internal Control Charter.

This charter defines the system applicable to all the French and foreign companies over which Mobilize F.S. has effective control and specifies in particular:

● the general arrangements for managing internal control;

● the local arrangements for subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures;

● the special arrangements for various functional areas.

Risk control at Mobilize Financial Services is overseen on three levels by separate functions:

364

The first line of defense is exercised by the operational functions in charge of day-to-day risk management as part of the activities in their area of expertise. These functions decide and are responsible for taking risks in the conducting of transactions and the objectives assigned to them. They exercise this responsibility in accordance with the management rules and the risk limits defined by the Corporate functional departments.

The Corporate functional departments are in charge of risk definition, rules, management methods, measurement and monitoring at the corporate level. Each department, in its area of expertise, manages and oversees the risk management system via guidelines and country objectives. Risk is monitored by periodic dedicated committees both in the subsidiaries and centrally. These departments rely on local representatives for risk measurement and exposure monitoring and ensure that limits are respected at the Group level.

The third line of defense is the internal audit function, which aims to provide assurance to Mobilize F.S. Board of Directors and Senior Management about the degree of control over transactions and the oversight exercised by the firsttwo lines.

The risk management system covers all the macroprocesses of Mobilize F.S. and includes the following tools:

● a list of the main so-called critical and significant risks for which a pilot, appetite level, alert thresholds and limits are defined (Risk Appetite Framework). For each risk, a detailed analysis is performed, identifying the components of the risk and the management and control principles that will enable the company to be in line with its risk appetite. These elements are reviewed at least once a year in line with the business model and strategy of Mobilize F.S. Group;

● mapping of operational management

he rules contributes to risk control; it is deployed in all the consolidated subsidiaries of Mobilize F.S. Group. This map is regularly updated by the central business departments. The level of control of operational

assessed the management rules is

annually by designated process owners, who are responsible for risk management in their respective areas of competence in line with Group standards, for defining and updating the corresponding procedures and first-level controls;

● a regulatory monitoring system run by the Risk and Department of the

Banking Regulations Risk Management Division, in liaison with officers in the Corporate Divisions, with a view to monitoring, analysing and informing operational staff of any regulatory changes affecting Mobilize F.S.;

●

the incident database, which it

collection makes possible to identify malfunctions corresponding to predefined criteria and to implement the corrective and preventive actions necessary to control risks. This database is used for internal and regulatory reporting purposes.

The system sets thresholds requiring immediate communication of incidents to the Mobilize F.S. Executive Committee, the Mobilize F.S. Board of Directors, the Renault Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee (ECC), the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) and the European Central Bank.

Within this framework, it devotes at least one annual meeting to reviewing the internal control system and validates the annual report on internal control sent to the ACPR.

In carrying out its tasks, the Board of Directors relies in particular on the work of four specialized committees of the Board:

● the Audit and Accounts Committee meets four times a year. It is responsible for preparing, presenting and monitoring the financial statements, overseeing the statutory audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, monitoring the independence of the statutory auditors and the definition of their non- auditing services, recommending the appointment of the statutory auditors and monitoring their rotation, verifying the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems,

audit reviewing the plan, analysing the audits

carried out and reviewing investments in unconsolidated companies;

● the Risk Committee meets at least four times a year. Its tasks include examining the risk maps and validating their definition, analysing and validating risk limits at Mobilize F.S. level in line with the Board's risk appetite. It assists the Board in terms of control. It is also responsible for analysing action plans in the event that limits or alert thresholds are exceeded and for examining the pricing systems for products and services. In parallel with the Compensation Committee, it also has the task of examining is

whether the compensation policy compatible with the company's risk exposure. With a view to advising the Board of Directors, this committee is also responsible for the analysis and approval of the internal control report, compliance with capital (ICAAP) and liquidity (ILAAP) regulations. The recovery plan and significant aspects of the rating and estimating processes derived from the company's internal credit risk models are also concerned;

● the Compensation Committee meets at least twice a year. It examines the compensation policy for company officers and the Head of Risk Management annually and

4.2Renault Group risk factors

04

Renault Group identifies risk factors to which it is exposed using its formal risk management approach, which is outlined in chapter 4.1 of this Document.

Risk factors presented in this chapter are those identified by the Group as significant factors that could, at the horizon of its medium-term strategic plan, have a negative impact on its image, its assets, the conduct of its activities and the achievement of its objectives, and whose criticality is rated at the highest levels on the Group’s risk scale. The risks presented in chapter 2.1.5 “Extra-financial performance” of this Document have been included in this analysis. Depending on their materiality, they fed into the description of certain risk factors. This is the case, for example, with risks related to global warming, the protection ofpersonal data or supplier relations.

However, it cannot be ruled out that other risk factors currently considered insignificant or not identified could adversely affect Renault Group in the future. Also, possible changes in the Group’s medium-term strategic plan could result in changes in the nature or relative importance of risk factors. It should be noted that the major risk mapping is updated every year, in close collaboration with the preparatory work and implementation of the strategic plan, so that the plan integrates the appropriate action plans designed to respond to the operational or strategic risks identified.

The major risk factors resulting from the Group’s analysis for all of its operating segments are summarized in the following table and presented below with their own level of criticality. In each of the five categories, risk factors with the higher criticality levels are described at the beginning. These same major risk factors are then presented in a two-dimensional matrix (impact and probability of occurrence). The thresholds for moving from one impact category to another were revised in 2022 to allow for a better prioritisation of the risks in the matrix and in the table.

4.2.1 Risks related to strategy

Global warning risks

Global warming risks are analyzed under two categories: transition risks and physical risks, which are detailed in section 2.3.2.1.4.1.

Transition risks

These risks are associated with developments towards a low-carbon economy, and all the adaptations that this involves.

The Group is subject to increasingly stringent and restrictive requirements concerning, on the one hand, the level of greenhouse gas emissions during the vehicle use phase: CAFE-type

regulations or local or regional restrictions or bans on certain vehicles or engines, and on the other hand, the level of emissions from the supply and production chains.

In addition, as part of its Renaulution strategic plan, the Group has made a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.

In this context, the risks for the Group are that it will not be able to comply with external constraints or fulfil its own commitments in terms of decarbonization or that the responses provided, particularly with regard to the introduction of electric and hybrid technologies, with varying performance in terms of customer service costs and CO2 emissions, will prove to be imperfectly adapted to market expectations or will result in additional costs incompatible with profitability requirements.

This risk is also assessed in terms of reputation: a mismatch between the

Group’s offering and

its climate commitments and the expectations of its stakeholders could damage its brand image, reducing its appeal to customers, suppliers and employees.

Lastly, the accelerated pace of technological development associated with this energy transition will create a need to update know-how by investing in training and acquiring new skills.

Risk management

The Group’s Climate Strategy, published in April 2021, sets out specific targets with action plans and monitoring indicators, which are detailed in chapter 2.3.2.1 of this Document.

This strategy is based on nine priority actions, covering both the vehicle use phase (scope 3 – Downstream), which accounts for almost 80% of the Group’s emissions, and the supply and manufacturing phases (scope 1, 2 and 3 – Upstream).

It is accompanied by strengthened governance as part of the Group’s overall Sustainable Development governance (see chapter 2.3.1.2 of this Document), involving all the departments concerned at the highest level, and is

04

supported by the implementation of proven tools and processes such as the “CAFE Control Tower” set up in 2019, which is responsible for steering the Group’s CAFE trajectories as well as the carbon footprint over the entire vehicle life cycle, reporting its results to the Leadership Team on a monthly basis.

The Group has also set up internal carbon pricing (ICP) to manage the reduction of its CO2 emissions by internalizing the economic cost of greenhouse gas emissions in its various areas: new vehicle projects, industrial facilities and procurement of parts and raw materials

(section 2.3.2.1.2.3).

Lastly, the management of these transition risks is integrated into the management of other risk factors, notably:

● risks of inadequate definition, product and service delivery or innovation;

● risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses;

● risks of supply chain disruption.

Physical risks

These are the consequences of climate change on the Group's activities.

Given the potential impact of extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, droughts) on the Group’s industrial and logistics activities, their increased frequency or intensity, linked to global warming, combined with a rise in temperatures and sea levels, are aggravating factors for these risks and could lead to an increase in prevention and maintenance costs and a rise in insurance premiums. Similarly, the increasing such as scarcity of some natural resources, water,

may impact production conditions in certain countries. The increasing use of certain raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, such as cobalt or lithium, may also create tensions.

Risk management

As the physical risks associated with climate change are essentially aggravating factors of existing risks, their treatment

is incorporated

into the corresponding

management systems:

● the analysis and monitoring of the risk of natural disasters and industrial accidents on our sites and supply chains are gradually incorporating the potential impacts of climate change. These risks are analyzed especially in the context of investment requests and the building maintenance strategy;

● the impact of global warming on the supply and extraction of certain raw materials is also integrated into the monitoring of the risk of supply chain disruption (see paragraph on raw materials);

● in the longer term, climate change is also a component of the risks associated with geopolitical instability and economic conditions.

Risk and control

In addition, these risks are monitored in the overall governance of sustainable development, environment and climate described in chapter 2.1.5.2, “Risk Mapping (EFPD-B)” of this Document. Actions are implemented across the board, such as, in 2022, a comprehensive study of the vulnerability of our industrial and logistics sites to extreme climate scenarios. This study served to identify the sites that could be the most affected by global warming according to these scenarios, to better qualify and quantify these risks - particularly those that are much more severe compared with the current situation - with a view to launching or reinforcing necessary preventive actions.

Risk ofinsufficient response to disruption of existing activities

The Group's activities face the risk of major disruptions, such as, for example, the development of digital resources that transform commercial

activities and promote disintermediation through the arrival of new players. These developments pose threats in particular to the Group's distribution strategy and after-sales activities.

Distribution strategy

The automotive

distribution

challenges that are also risks:

model faces

several

● changing customer needs and concerns, with growing environmental awareness and the need for the network to contribute to the marketing of new personalised mobility offers;

● changes to regulations, particularly European ones, to take account of the changing commercial environment due to the development of online car sales;

● the emergence of new competitors favouring direct distribution to position themselves on the European market, and relying on high-performance digital tools;

● constraints linked to the macro-economic environment.

greater profitability and distribution cost-reduction

Management system

The Group's distribution strategy is being transformed to meetthese challenges, with the following aims:

● offer the customer a "phygital" customer journey and develop e-commerce;

● manage the vehicle's entire life cycle to secure each activity, maximise profitability and strengthen customer loyalty;

● capitalise on the growth of the used-car market to improve brand and network performance.

Renault Group has chosen to capitalise on its network by integrating it into the new value chains, while at the same time developing the distribution contract to tighten the representation standards of the brands. The new Renault Group European distribution contract will come into force at the beginning of 2024. This contract places the Group's requirements around five inseparable activities: new vehicles, used-vehicle sales under the Renault label,

distribution of after-sales

products, repair

and

370

maintenance services,

and

financing

services and solutions. This flexible contract facilitates the pooling of certain activities and back-office synergies, enabling the Group to strengthen its selectivity criteria and optimise network costs.

After-sales activity

The after-sales activity, which is essential in terms of profit and customer a

satisfaction, is undergoing profound transformation with the arrival of new players and new technologies. It faces three types of risks:

● the increase in the number of electric vehicles shall cause the average cost of maintenance and servicing operations to fall due to the less complex nature of electrical components, and it also favours the arrival of new players;

● connectivity technology opens up new opportunities (remote access to the vehicle, transformation of customer experience), but also reduces the number of accidents and therefore the number of workshop visits;

● the independent aftermarket represents a significant and growing share of the market, and is giving rise to new players, who are focused on intermediation with a strong digital component.

Risk management

To meet after-sales challenges, the Group has implemented an after-sales strategy based on three avenues:

● deliver a best-in-class customer experience in line with each brand's promises, while making use of common and modernised assets (logistics, digitalisation of the customer journey and network tools) to generate more value;

● deliver offers adapted to the entire life cycle of the vehicle, in terms of repairs and customisation, in order to increase customer loyalty, particularly among those who own an old vehicle;

● develop a relevant, qualitative independent aftermarket (IAM) offer based on the manufacturer's experience, both physical and digital, in order to win over new multi- brand customers and win back customers who have left our networks. This offer is supported by the companies, Motrio, Kadensis and Fixter.

Risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses

Against a background of deep and sustained transformation in demand and the mobility offerings, in line with societal

changes and environmental and climate issues, Renault Group could be faced with an inadequate ability, within a given time frame, to change its business model, to anticipate and adapt to changes and possible disruptions of markets, mobility offers and related value chains, and thus to develop new business. This could lead to lower revenues than the objectives for the affected portions of the Group’s commercial offering, as a result of a lack of innovation and inadequate preparation for its future, beyond the deadlines of the current strategic plan.

Risk management

The Group's strategic plan aims to turn this risk into an opportunity by mobilizing (if necessary through the use of new of the

organizations) the resources Group, partnerships and targeted acquisitions, so as to structure a strong and innovative sustainable, electric, autonomous and connected mobility offer. These innovative service offerings are housed within the automotive brands, the Mobilize Business Unit created in 2020 and include the following initiatives:

● in May 2022, on the occasion of a capital market day, Mobilize presented its missions which are to find solutions to the gap between the use and the cost of vehicles, to respond to the problems of rapid decrease in values and goods, and participate in reducing the environmental impact of the automobile, accompanied by concrete projects and quantified objectives;

● the Refactory project in Flins, Europe's first circular- economy plant dedicated to mobility, launched on 25 November 2020, is another example of the ongoing move towards innovative offers. This concept has been developed in other Group entities, for example, in Seville, Spain (announcement of 5 November 2021;

● in October 2022, Renault announced the creation of a new entity, THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL, a specialist in closed-loop recycling that is reliant on the Refactory. It aims to help the entire automotive industry move towards resource neutrality by increasing the proportion ofrecycled materials in the production of new vehicles;

● in April 2021, Renault Group joined forces with Atos, Dassault Systèmes, STMicroelectronics and Thales to create “Software République”: a new open ecosystem for intelligent and sustainable mobility. Its aim is to jointly develop and market intelligent mobility systems, enabling an adapted and agile mobility offer. In 2022, Software République an incubator

launched and developed projects in the fields of cybersecurity, data management for the regions, smart charging stations, and training.

Risk ofinadequate performance by the Alliance

Renault Group’s membership in the Renault-Nissan- Mitsubishi Alliance makes a major contribution to the success of the Group and its strategic plan. In the market context of the health crisis and difficulties in the supply of semiconductors and in the

deteriorated financial performance of its members, the Alliance companies have focused their strategy on efficiency and unit profitability of vehicles rather than on volumes. This situation could lead to a risk of underperformance due to a lack of prioritization of

platforms, technologies and, more generally, of the investments needed to develop product ranges,

threatening the future competitiveness of the Group's offer, its revenues and its targeted profits. This risk can also be assessed in reputational terms: insufficient cooperation between the Alliance partners, given the market's potential and expectations, could result in a loss of confidence and a reduced attractiveness of the Group to some of its stakeholders, and negatively impact its development. The transition to the end of diesel and the product cycle could also lead to a decline in business volume between Nissan and Renault. Finally, Nissan's financial situation could limit the distribution of dividends to the Group for this year.

Risk management

The Alliance Operating Board (AOB), created on 12 March 2019, is responsible for operational coordination between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corporate and for new initiatives

creating value for their respective employees. On May 27, 2020, the

shareholders and

Alliance announced the

new “leader/follower” cooperation business model in order to improve the competitiveness and profitability of its three member companies. Alliance members ensure they are always at the forefront of the industry in terms of their performance, products, technologies and markets, while continuing to benefit from joint purchasing and development. In mid- 2021, three “Alliance Strategy Days“ were organized within the framework of the AOB meetings to take stock of ongoing projects, propose new opportunities and ensure the development of synergies.

On January 27, 2022, the members of the Alliance announced their actions and projects to build their joint future by 2030, with a focus on the new mobility value chain.

By 2022, as an illustration of this joint work, Megane E-Tech was launched on the common CMF-EV platform also used by Nissan Ariya. Megane E-Tech also inaugurated GAS (Google Automotive Services), based on a common electronic architecture, a world first for a generalist carmaker, which will be extended more widely across all ranges in years the to come. Common electronic architecture, a world first for a mass-market carmaker, which will be extended more widely across all ranges in the years to come.

On February 6, 2023, the Alliance members announced the redesign of the relationship between the 3 companies, for a more efficient, balanced, strong and fast cooperation, with

a rebalancing of cross-shareholdings and new operational projects with strong value creation, in technology, products and regions. The Alliance members will ensure that they are always at the top of the industry in terms of performance, products, technologies and markets, by continuing to rely on joint procurement and development.

4.2.2 Risks related to operations

Risk of supply chain disruption

Renault Group's business relies on a complex system of supply and delivery chains, both upstream and

downstream of its production sites. Various components of these supply chains may fail, despite the existing control system, the characteristics of which are described below. These failures could lead to technical, planning or economic inefficiencies, or even interruptions in

production, transport and/or delivery of vehicles to distribution networks and end customers, with negative consequences for sales, revenues, profits and customer satisfaction. These potential failures may be either internal - due in particular to the underlying

interdependence of the Group's industrial network (see chapter 1.1.2 "Strategy" or 1.2.1.2 "The business-to-business Powertrain activity" of this document) - or external, as illustrated the the

by Covid-19 health crisis or semiconductor supply crisis, and can be analyzed according to the following typology:

● supplier failure;

● disruption in supply or transport systems;

● disruption in supply of raw materials.

Supplier failure

Renault Group relies on a Tier 1 strategic supplier base comprising more than 800 parts supplier groups and more

than 400

service

providers, with which it maintains significant business relationships. These suppliers may present risks of disruption in the design and production of compliant quality parts, in meeting delivery deadlines, in providing the necessary production capacity and in the financial, strategic, industrial, social and management, supply chain, sustainable development and compliance fields.

Due to the semiconductor crisis, which lasted longer than expected, sharp rise in the energy and raw-material costs, and the accelerating decline in internal-combustion engines, 2021 and 2022 saw a further weakening of the supplier base in all countries where Renault Group sources its supplies. These factors have contributed to the significant increase in the number of suppliers that are at risk. This proportion, usually between 5% and 10%, was in the range of 20% to 25% at the end of 2022, with a significant proportion of suppliers potentially defaulting within one year despite a vigorous remediation program put in place by Renault Group in 2022.

The elements of structural fragility of the supplier fabric already mentioned, accompanied by

unfavorable economic factors, in particular the rise in interest rates, the increased volatility of exchange rates and the increase in the levels of public and private debt, lead to think that the number of business failures will increase in 2023.

372 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

In addition, announcements related to the energy transition, including a complete halt to the release of internal combustion engine vehicles on the market within the European Union in 2035, have led to anticipatory behavior on the part of suppliers and their customers. This behavior could result in a reduction in the number of suppliers as well as a necessary restructuring of those whose trades will be impacted (especially in foundry, forging, machining, etc.). It is therefore the entire supplier base that must be considered carefully over the next years.

Risk management

The Group applies a comprehensive risk management system based on various measures:

● a prevention policy designed to make suppliers accountable for their own risks and in particular the compliance and robustness of their own supply chain;

● use of Alliance standards for products in development by suppliers;

● an Alliance capacity reference system process aimed at controlling, within a two-year time frame, supply risks not covered by the existence of available industrial capacities;

● an process Alliance for detecting non-compliance (quality, traceability) of parts delivered;

● monitoring of intrinsic supplier risks: annual multi- criterion ratings, financial and default risks (Alliance grid);

● monitoring of the risks created by the relationship between Renault Group (or other customers) and its suppliers by analyzing indicators such as (i) the proportion represented by Renault Group or the main customer in revenues, (ii) the market share of the supplier in the Group’s panel, and (iii) the range’s exposure to individual failure. Vigilance is especially reinforced insofar as Renault Group does not have a systematic policy of multi-sourcing;

● implementation of action plans on the detection of non- compliance or supplier risk.

This supplier risk prevention and management system was strengthened in 2022 with, in particular:

● the extension of the visibility given to suppliers on the order book to achieve twelve-month visibility;

● the development of risk control processes based on the good practices implemented to manage the Covid-19 and semiconductor crises, with, in particular, the start of a POC on the sharing of forecasts, and research to gain a better understanding of the supply chains (rank n);

● the implementation of risk control measures with a greater degree of anticipation than in previous processes, which can be up to two years of anticipation;

● consideration of supplier risk on comprehensive parameters from the outset of processing, including industrial, engineering, financial, human, etc. aspects;

● the launch of a cyber-certification project for suppliers (TISAX standard).

The prevention policy concerns both risks under human control such as those listed, and risks outside human control (natural disasters for example). Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi thus have a business continuity plan program.

In addition, Renault Group has created, in association with The Adecco Group, the 1901 Auto ADE-RE association, the purpose of which is to diagnose needs and support suppliers and their employees in retraining operations in order to anticipate and best manage the impact of decisions related to the shutdown of internal combustion vehicles in 2035 in Europe.

Disruption of supply or transport systems

The risks identified

relate

to planning, production, transport or delivery interruptions of parts, upstream of vehicle production sites, or vehicles, downstream of these sites, which could impact sales, revenues, profits of the Group or customer satisfaction. Among these risks, we are seeing a steady increase in cybersecurity risk among our logistics suppliers.

Among these risks, we are seeing a steady increase in cybersecurity risk among our logistics suppliers. In 2022, we also saw an increase in transport risks (capacity and cost) due to the shortage of drivers, the impact of new regulations and the energy crisis, connected to the geopolitical context.

These risks, which are assessed in the dual context of the interdependence of the Group’s industrial network extended to its global suppliers and the footprint of the distribution network (in particular, see chapter 1.1.5.4 of this document), are subject to a comprehensive prevention and protection system whose robustness is constantly being strengthened.

Risk management

The Covid–19 and electronic-component crises have demonstrated the ability of the supply chain to operate in a short loop to be more responsive to fluctuations in the environment. The "commercial demand

04

vs industrial response" balancing process was able to operate effectively on a weekly basis instead of monthly. This made to validate the

experience has

it possible

effectiveness of our digital tools, to improve their scope and to build new ones. The

supply chain crisis management system, deployed for many years, is the central tool for responding to occasional crises and hazards (border blockages, blockage of the Suez Canal, meteorological crises, shortage of means of transport, cybersecurity …). The supply chain has also actively contributed to multi-business groups for risk assessment and resolution during crises

related

to electronic components, plastics, steel, etc.

In this context, the supply chain has developed a "Control Tower" program, which is now in the operational start-up phase for upstream logistics. Through the roll-out of digital processes and with an end-to-end vision, it aims to manage risks at the appropriate of the

levels organizations and to apply consistent methods between the Group's various regions and business lines. The program, which covers the risks of supplier failures as well as the risks of the supply and transport system, aims to:

● detect demand through an integrated sales and operational planning process and measure the impact of supplier disruption on vehicle diversity;

● manage supply capacity and supplier failures ;

● manage the logistics capacities of transporters, warehouses and fleets : deployment of the parts flow traceability project;

● anticipate risks and manage them operationally.

A cybersecurity audit of supply systems carried out in 2022 made it possible to strengthen the system.

Renault Group Risk and control

Disruption in supply of raw materials

The risks identified relate to potential supply restrictions (imbalance between supply and demand, sourcing difficulties, geopolitical disturbances in particular), raw material prices, the variations of which may be significant and sudden, as well as non-compliance with ESG criteria (Environment, Social, Governance). Raw materials represent around a third of the total value of the Group's purchases. Three-quarters of raw material purchases are considered strategic because they are likely to have a significant impact on production conditions or present significantimbalances between supply and demand.

In 2022, the sharp rise in energy costs disrupted the production of certain energy-intensive raw materials and created strong tensions on supplies in a context of demand made very volatile by the semiconductor crisis.

The geopolitical context and the regionalization of markets has also disrupted existing supply/demand balances, as has the gradual transition to carbon-free materials.

Risk management

Against a backdrop of highly volatile raw material prices and changes in energy mixes (petrol, diesel, electrified vehicles), Renault Group is supplementing its purchasing, technical, monitoring and hedging policies in order to identify and limit supply and cost overrun risks.

For purchasing policies, Renault Group continues to develop multi-sourcing for materials such as steel or cast aluminum so as to optimize costs while securing supplies. The Group is also reinforcing the control of materials contained in parts and components through a panel of approved materials and the performance of detailed analysis of material prices in the costing of parts.

In terms of technical policies, the Group is actively working to reduce the use of, or to substitute, sensitive materials (e.g. palladium, rhodium and rare earths). It continues to also develop the use of recycled materials (precious metals in particular) and the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. The launch of the Refactory in Flins in 2020 and the creation in October 2022 of "THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL", the new entity dedicated to the circular economy, are further steps in this direction.

With regard to strategic materials for batteries, the Group wants to secure the supply of responsible materials and share control of the value chain with the players in the chain. As a result, agreements for the supply of lithium or low-carbon nickel were signed in 2021 and 2022, and Renault Group plans to extend this type of agreement to materials other than those specific to batteries.

In a forward-looking approach, the Group reassesses its forecasts on a bi-monthly basis for the main indexed and non-indexed items. At the same time, it ensures ongoing monitoring of critical materials markets and suppliers.

374

Finally, to reduce risks and limit exposure to market fluctuations, Renault

Group negotiates annual raw

materials supply contracts whenever possible and appropriate. A systematic hedging policy has been put in place for the main indexed commodities.

Risks related to geopolitical instability and economic conditions

Renault Group has industrial and commercial operations in a large number of countries (see chapters 1.1.5 and 1.2.1.4 of this document). Some of these countries may present specific risks that could have an adverse impact on the Group’s industrial and commercial operations, sales, revenues, income statement or balance sheet, despite a geographical spread of sales that limits the overall impact of regional contingencies while taking advantage of opportunities. These risks and opportunities may relate to the changing economic related situations, political or regulatory instability, social unrest, protectionism, nationalizations, fluctuating interest rates and exchange rates, lack of foreign currency liquidity or foreign exchange control measures.

Since 2021, automotive markets were impacted by disruptions in the supply of electronic components and raw materials as well as insufficient maritime transport from plants.

This components crisis continued into 2022, and was accompanied by an energy and raw materials crisis linked to the war in Ukraine, leading to the return or acceleration of inflation in most countries and increased volatility of interest rates and exchange rates.

All of these elements contributed to weaken the sector’s economic situation. These disruptions were experienced in all markets by most automotive industry actors.

Specific risks

The Group’s activities remain heavily dependent on the European market, which in 2022 represents two-third (64%) of the Group’s sales (see the Group’s worldwide sales in chapter 1.2.1.1 of this document and the breakdown of sales by country).

Outside Europe, the countries or areas that expose the Group most by their weight in sales and/or total production are Russia, Morocco, Turkey and the Americas. The respective weights in the Group’s vehicle sales and production are as follows for each of these countries or areas (see chapters 1.2.1.1 and 1.2.1.3 of this document for sales and production figures for 2021): Morocco (3%, 15%), Turkey (7%, 11%) and the Americas (14%, 13%). Despite their limited weight in the Group's vehicle sales and production, China and the Asia-Pacific region occupy a crucial place in the battery and electric-vehicle value chain.

Financial statements

In Turkey, Renault Group is exposed to geopolitical risk as well as to macroeconomic and regulatory instability. As a result, the market is highly volatile, leading the Group to implement a risk management policy, currently under development, aimed adaptability of its production system and the preparation of alternative solutions for the main logistics flows. Major political events in 2023 (presidential and parliamentary elections in June, centenary of the Republic of Turkey in October) willreceive special attention.

at combining the short-term to

In Morocco, the exposure to risk of non-transfer on imports is limited

by

the exported production. The potential impact of regional tensions remains to be monitored.

Latin America is gradually returning to pre-COVID-19 levels of GDP and employment, although the repercussions of the health crisis and the war in Ukraine are expected to have lasting consequences for the economies of the region (inflation record of 94.8% in Argentina for the year 2022).

In a context marked by recent electoral alternations (Brazil, Colombia), the strong political polarization in most Latin American countries remains a source of tension and instability. Latin America is also exposed to a wide range of natural hazards and is expected to be one of the regions in the world where the effects and impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, fires and droughts, and the fall in agricultural yields will be the mostintense.

In Asia, strategic competition between the US and China intensified in 2022, and is expected to continue over the long term. In addition to technological and commercial rivalry, geopolitical tension between the two countries is

centred around

Taiwan. Battery and electric-vehicle supply chains - of all manufacturers - would be particularly exposed in the event of a conflict in the Asia- Pacific region.

Risk management

In terms of industrial location, Renault Group’s geographical choices are made taking into account the risks of instability built into a global industrial approach in order to

ensure risk

diversification. Manufacturing investments

represent a major part of the Group’s exposure to

political risks. Country risk related to manufacturing and financial investment is in principle not hedged, but the risk of non-achievement of objectives is included in the expected profitability calculation. From an operational standpoint, the Group continuously increases the level of local integration in order to reduce the impact of political and foreign exchange risks and make its products more competitive.

In addition, the Group hedges against the risk of non- payment for most payments originating from high-risk countries. The main exceptions relate to intra-Group sales, sales to industrial partners and to countries for which there is no possible hedging. Residual country risk is regularly monitored.

Risk and control

In order to centrally manage the risk of non-payment and put in place hedges on competitive terms, the Group has designed a “hub and spoke”

invoicing system. Manufacturing subsidiaries sell their exported production Renault S.A.S., which sells it on to commercial subsidiaries and independent importers, granting them supplier credit. The associated risk is managed by the parent company. Some sales between countries covered by customs agreements do not use this system, however.

In the light of the economic situation resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and the geopolitical context and inflationary shocks, in 2022 the Renault Group continued to manage the reactions to be implemented within the company, with suppliers upstream and the network and customers downstream, in a coordinated manner and as close to the ground as possible, using a multi-business approach. In addition, in 2021 and 2022, Renault Group continued to reduce fixed costs and restructure industrial capacity to lower the company's breakeven point, eliminating unprofitable sales and working on net pricing to offset most

of the exogenous impacts. These developments have been an essential asset in managing market

and production changes linked to supply disruptions and will be capitalized on for the future. In addition, the global inflationary context is well integrated into the Group's budgetary assumptions and market forecasts, including in the form of a more or less deteriorated scenario. This flexibility, which is as close as possible to market trends, is at the heart of the Renault Group's efforts to protect employees, optimize financial performance and seize every possible opportunity.

As from February 2022, the conflict in Ukraine and its consequences for

the Group's activity have been continuously monitored with all the teams concerned, primarily to ensure the physical integrity and safety of employees. As soon as they were published, Renault Group analysed the consequences of the economic and financial sanctions and counter-sanctions that were progressively decided; the Group ensures that they are strictly respected in the context of its activities. On 16 May 2022, Renault Group's Board of Directors unanimously approved the signing of agreements to sell 100% of Renault Group's shares in Renault Russia to the city of Moscow and its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to NAMI (the Central research and development automobile and engine institute).

Renault Group Risk and control

Social Risk

In an unstable economic, environmental and health context, major changes are putting pressure on the company's activity. In this situation, the Renaulution strategic plan entails a transformation that will lead to changes in the organization and new business models, in particular through the creation of new entities and partnerships. Energy transition issues and aggravating external factors such as the shortage of electronic components and rising prices of raw materials could lead the Group to take measures relating to the employment conditions of its people. In addition, an increase in inflation in countries where Renault Group has significant operations could lead to pressure on costs at the local level.

In this environment, the Group runs the risk of being confronted with social movements in the countries where it operates, which could disrupt its activities.

Management system

Building on its global framework agreements of 2013 and 2019, Renault Group has a dynamic of social dialogue both at the global level through its Group Works Council and at the local level with employee representative bodies. Renault Group is committed to dealing with these changes and the associated risks through regular, qualitative social dialogue, allowing global and/or local agreements to be reached and to change these bodies if necessary

Risk of natural, health or industrial disasters

The group’s operating sites, whether manufacturing sites, engineering and testing centers, logistics platforms or even commercial sites are exposed to the risk of industrial accidents, fires, explosions and machine breakdowns. In addition, some facilities (see in particular chapter 1.2.1.3. of this document presenting the main industrial sites) are subject to the risk of natural disasters: earthquakes (particularly in Chile, Turkey, Romania, Colombia, Slovenia and Morocco), as well as floods or submersions (particularly in France and Korea). With the latter risks being increased by the higher frequency of external climate events related to global warming.

The occurrence of any of these risks, despite the prevention and resilience policies presented below, could harm people,

the environment or the sites concerned

and lead

to

significant disruptions in the ability to operate affected sites – potentially damaging the Group’s assets and/or overall performance (sales, revenues, income statement or balance sheet), particularly through industrial interdependencies.

A global pandemic, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, can

result in significant and shifting health threats in countries where the group operates. Such situations may be accompanied by measures imposing restrictions on the free movement of people and goods, disrupting the opening of sales or after-sales outlets in distribution networks and the smooth running of industrial sites. The main impacts of such situations would be on the health and availability of the Group’s personnel and its suppliers, as well as on financial performance (revenues, cash flow and cash) and, potentially, the value of certain balance sheet assets. In addition to the direct impact on people and business, the pandemic has collateral effects on the organization of logistics flows and supplies worldwide.

Risk management

Over the past 30 years, Renault Group has been committed to implementing and developing an ambitious and rigorous prevention policy (safety of people, property and business continuity). More than 94% of the assets (industry, engineering and logistics) covered by the “property damage and insurance were

business interruption”

program awarded the international “Highly Protected Risk (HPR)” label in 2021, which reflects a level of prevention and protection approved by insurance companies.

In addition, the Group as a whole is working to increase its resilience to natural disasters. In particular, the treatment of seismic risk at the most at-risk sites has been completed in Chile and Turkey, and is being pursued in Romania under a specific multi-year plan: reinforcement of buildings and facilities, staff training, specific communications resources, crisis management systems, business continuity and an appropriate insurance program.

With regard to the health crisis, Renault Group has put in place permanent measures to protect the health of its employees, in conjunction with the public authorities, to preserve its assets and its ability to operate and to adapt to situations

changing in the various countries. An ongoing monitoring system makes it possible to track the evolution of the situation and to mobilize the crisis mechanism if necessary. The provisions mainly concern

work organization,

management interruptions and resumptions in line with local measures and commercial demand.

4.2.3 Risks related to products and services

04

Risk of definition, product and service delivery or inadequate innovation

In the fast-changing environment of the automotive markets, regulations, market trends, customer expectations and technologies, linked to societal, environmental and climate issues, Renault Group is exposed to a risk of an insufficient match between its capacity for innovation, its product and services offering and the expectations of the various markets, which could adversely impact its sales, revenues or income statement.

Specific risks have been identified relating to:

● enhancement of the technological content of vehicles

and related ecosystems, especially with regard to vehicle connectivity and related services and the development of electrified and, in the longer term, autonomous vehicles and in the fields of electronics and software (see chapter 1.4.1 “Technologies of the future” ofthis document);

● continual increases in the cost of vehicles resulting from more stringent regulations, the accounting of which through corrective changes in sale prices could prove excessively difficult, thus weakening the economic balance and the future of certain products;

● with regard to the Euro 7 regulations, this risk is reinforced by the significant technical gaps induced by the draft regulations to date, in a tight regulatory schedule with regard to industrial deadlines, which could lead to significant over-investment;

● the Group's specific and resolute ambition regarding electric vehicles, in a context of intense and complex industrial and markets dynamics and with an uncertain time frame, notably conditioned by the development of ecosystems

(charging, battery recycling), and by regional regulations (CAFE, for example, in Europe - see chapter 1.5.1.2. "Pollutant and CO2 emissions"), and increasingly skewed by aid policies or restrictions at all levels (region, country, city) and in many forms (driving restrictions or bans), as well as by the rise in the price of electric technology linked to the energy and raw- material crises;

● the current transition of the powertrain offer, in terms of technologies (petrol, diesel, electrical hybridization of internal combustion engines, electrical) and mix. In particular, the choice of hybridization technology, which is particularly sensitive to costs and also offers differentiated customer and CO2 performance, could turn be out

to paced, imperfectly adapted or the markets,

depending on

products and

thus potentially going against the overall technological and financial optimization defined by the group for its CAFE trajectory; the profitability of

● preserving

Renault Group’s investments in the context in which the group intends to

maintain its R&D investments within a range of 8% to 9% revenues between 2021

of

and 2025;

this being compared to approximately 10% of revenues in previous years. This necessity could increase the risk weighing on the choices made about innovations and the chances of seeing those innovations match real expectations of customers and

therefore

generate

returns on

investment.

Should the reference assumptions used in the Group’s product development decisions be strongly called into question, the Group may have to recognize impairment on fixed assets (investment and capitalized development expenses, depreciated over the life of the vehicle) or book a provision to cover the contractual indemnities to be paid, if any, due to the failure to meet a minimum purchase volume.

Risk management

The definition of the group’s future products is based on customer studies and

analyses

of automotive competitors, so that market expectations and developments and industry trends can be identified. It is also increasingly informed, on a global scale, by anticipatory technology watch by all of the group’s development stakeholders, of the automotive industry and

beyond. The development of new models or components is decided on the basis of this work and an evaluation of the anticipated profitability, calculated over the projected life cycle.

Renault Group has redefined its entire product and technology development portfolio from July 2020 under the leadership of its new CEO. A new brand organization has been set up in early 2021 to ensure that it is as close as possible to consumer expectations. Brand markers have been defined to ensure that product and service content is consistent with the relative positioning of each brand. These brands are able to make the most appropriate

choices and

trade-offs in order

to strengthen their specific identities, and can draw on the expertise of the core businesses and on the bodies and technologies developed at Alliance level or with partners (e.g. Google, see below).

The group can thus develop products that will offer all types of engines (petrol, diesel, electric and electrified, LPG, hydrogen), increased connectivity for its vehicles and the driving aids expected by its customers. For example:

● at the end of 2020, the company launched a major

innovation on the hybridization market with

the E-Tech hybrid and plug-in hybrid engines, which, in addition to the electric range, make it possible to meet CAFE regulatory requirements;

● Megane E-Tech, launched in 2022, is the first consumer vehicle to integrate the Google automotive platform;

● in the key area of battery technologies, the roadmap presented during the “Renault E-Ways” event on 30 June 2021 highlighted the desire to locate battery sourcing as close as possible to plants, the choice of a dual offer

through partnerships with Envision AESC for a cost- competitive battery as well as with the start-up Verkor for a high-performance battery, and lastly the design of

a standardized cell architecture

able

to reduce

manufacturing costs and increase battery energy efficiency;

● finally, on the occasion of the Capital Market Day on

8 November

2022,

the Group announced the

forthcoming creation of two new entities which will be instrumental in this transition:

● the Horse project, in which Renault Group will combine

its internal-combustion and hybrid engine technologies with those of Geely to create a world- leading equipment manufacturer;

● the creation of Ampere, the first electric and software pure player born out of the disruption of a traditional

car manufacturer, which will

rely on high-tech partnerships with

Google and Qualcomm, in

particular.

From a general perspective, to ensure the robustness of the product plan and keep risks under control, the group strives to:

● maximize the distribution of the same model in different markets, which

reduces its exposure

to possible

fluctuations in one of these markets;

● optimize outlay by simultaneously developing cars in the same segment for several brands, combining design differentiation and maximum technical commonality;

● offer a varied, balanced product portfolio that meets customer expectations in different segments and markets, so as to reduce the risk of dependency on a single market, segment or customer type;

● offer a diversified and adaptable engine portfolio (ICE, LPG, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric, hydrogen) to meet customer expectations in different markets and enable potential changes in the engine mix to be supported;

● develop, with its Alliance partners, a limited number of standardised technical platforms (for example: CMF EV and CMF-B EV) to maximize economies of scale for component volumes and costs, and facilitate their reuse from one region to another;

● control the robustness of main product development milestones so as to secure the market launch schedule

of new products, in particular by strengthening governance through the increased involvement of top management. The upstream phases are thus now more robust due to their level of detail, their 360° business vision and a handover from the “Concept Freeze” milestone to the company’s brands and downstream.

Risk of product or service quality defects

The quality of Renault Group’s products and services could be considered insufficiently competitive by potential customers in the face of the competition, which would adversely affect the satisfaction of its customers or partners, and negatively affect its sales, revenues, costs or reputation.

This risk is specifically considered within the stringent environment of major changes

in the automotive technologies implemented by the group as part of its strategic plan (for current models, see chapter 1.1.5.1., “Automotive: brands and ranges” or 1.3.3 “Innovations in vehicle and

new service

in 2021 for projects developments” of this Document as well as the chapter 1.3.1 mentionning “Technologies of tomorrow”).

Risk management

Control of this risk

has been reinforced

by the implementation of a specific Quality plan. It relies in particular on quality assurance systems implemented within the Group’s operating activities as well as on functional safety organization and activities and general product safety, aiming to protect against the risks related to the physical integrity of people involved in road use, starting with the users of the Group’s products and services.

The Group has also set up a market monitoring system that allows it to become aware of sources of customer dissatisfaction very quickly and to act accordingly. This is done, in particular, through a process for correcting quality issues, which has been strengthened, including a recall process for, as a matter of priority, those problems that could have regulatory or potentially safety-related consequences.

Risk of cyberattack and failure ofinformation systems

The conduct

of Renault

Group’s activities depends, continuously and increasingly, on the proper functioning of its IT and information systems. Developments in the group’s strategy and its new challenges (cloud strategy, digitization, Industry 4.0, development of connected services or strengthening of the cybersecurity regulatory environment in particular) are tending to increase its exposure to threats and making cybersecurity a major challenge.

The main risks that could adversely affect the Group's activities are related to:

● cybercrime: global computerized attacks or attacks targeting the Group’s interests or, as a side effect, national interests. These attacks, in a context of strong growth, may aim to access sensitive data (strategic, product, service or personal data), to steal or alter them, to block services or even all of the Group’s information systems;

● incidents that could affect the continuity of services hosted in our infrastructures and those of our partners and suppliers;

● non-compliance with IT standards or practices required by legislation, external authorities or contracts with suppliers or the state of the art.

The materialization of these risks, despite the continuous strengthening of systems aimed at controlling them, could have

major financial impacts related to the temporary suspension of the Group’s activities – of all types – (revenues, earnings), to penalties or to increased insurance premiums. There could also be adverse impacts on the Group’s image and the confidence of third parties and customers in the Group and its brands.

In addition, Renault Group’s increased marketing of connected vehicles and services (in particular, see chapters 1.3.1 and 1.3.2) is accompanied by the emergence of risks of a comparable nature, for which insufficiently robust and sustainable management could lead to adverse impacts on safety and the reliability of data, services or vehicles.

Risk management

The general control of these risks is currently provided at the operational level via:

● the deployment of security policies (e.g. controlling information, information system security, vehicle cybersecurity management system, IT charter and IT code of conduct) and the continuous enhancement of the process of defining security requirements according to the level of criticality of the applications and data handled;

● the translation of policiesinto operational procedures;

● the deployment of an evolving action plan based on a security Master plan and annual risk mapping. The

security Master plan is updated and presented on a regular basis to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR).

At the organizational and governance level, it is provided in particular by:

● global cybersecurity organization across the company;

● the Risk and Internal Control Committee;

● governance committees monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of information security processes and measures.

In view of the Group’s key strategic priorities, its digitalization and the evolution of threats, the major actions

to optimize risk management are currently focused on the following areas:

● monitoring by reviewing performance indicators (e.g. average resolution time for major and critical incidents, Bitsight rating and indicators regarding key obligations under the GDPR);

● a major program to strengthen security at the Group’s various plants;

● development of vehicle cybersecurity and associated services in connection with the need to comply with the new regulations (UNECE R155 & R156) on vehicle cybersecurity. In early 2022, Renault Group obtained official certification from UTAC for the management of its cybersecurity (CSMS);

● enhanced supervision (Security Operations Centre – SOC) of systems in all the Group’s domains (in particular IS/IT, vehicles, connected services, cloud infrastructure and plants);

● strengthening of awareness,

training and

skills regarding cybersecurity;

● strengthening of the protection of the Group’s systems/ infrastructures (including those that use cloud hosting);

● participation in international and national ecosystem interest groups (e.g. PFA, Cyber Campus, ACEA). PFA, Cyber Campus, ACE).

Risk of ineffective digital transformation

In 2016, the Group initiated a digital transformation that, led by the IT function, aims to allow all the Functions to improve their productivity, reduce their costs and create new sources of value. This transformation involves both organizational and technical changes, including poor governance that could lead to a loss of efficiency and competitiveness of the Group.

Management system

Since 2016, digital transformation has been governed by each function and the Renault

Digital subsidiary is accelerating this transformation. In 2022, the Group specified its five-year, medium-term digital plan. A total of eight business areas have been defined as new value

chains for the Group: digital development of vehicles, industrial performance, upstream & downstream logistics, sales and customer service, after-sales, support functions, service development, operation of sales and services. Governance of the digital project portfolio is in place in the form of a Control Tower in the functions. For each of the projects, a joint business/IT steering team has been created with the aim of meeting the digital challenges that will enable the expected business results to be achieved, with particular attention given to the resources required and to the correct architecture of the data and digital solutions. Such governance is associated with the steering of projects and the value they generate at Board of Management level. The IT director is a member of the Group's Board of Management, which enables steering to take place at the highest level.

Risk of a lack of resources and talent

In light of the digital revolution, rapid technological breakthroughs and new needs in terms of mobility services, the Group's aim is to turn itself into a competitive technology and services company. As a result, its skills requirements are evolving at all qualification levels, and the Group must ensure that it has the best professionals in its class. The company must meet the challenge of attracting, retaining and developing talent. Thus, in a highly competitive labour market, which is no longer limited to the automotive sector, the risk for the company is that it will not be able to attract or retain the talent

needed to fulfil

its strategic ambitions or for its

transformation.

Management system

To constantly adapt to

transformed roles

in the automotive sector and to shape future mobility, the Group has introduced a HR policy to make it fast-moving, innovative, effective and eager to learn, and to support the commitment and motivation of its employees on the basis ofthe following actions:

● recruitment of staff with a very wide range of profiles and expertise in all the countries in which the Group operates;

● promotion of diversity and inclusion, in particular by strengthening the Group's ambition to be a leader in the automotive sector, and by boosting the growing share of women in management positions;

●

employee development and training through an adapted, personalised and modernised training offer, supported an

by extended community (ReKnow University, Learning & Development);

●

a competitive compensation policy, combined with enhanced performance monitoring and appraisal;

● a solid, international and cross-functional approach to identify, develop and retain talent.

Risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including corruption

As a result of its international activities, Renault Group is subject to increasingly numerous, complex and shifting laws and regulations, particularly in the areas of automotive manufacturing, the environment, competition, labor law,

new technologies and cybersecurity (in particular, see chapter 1.5 “Regulatory environment” of this document).

The group could therefore find itself exposed to a change in laws or regulations that were insufficiently anticipated or incorrectly taken into account by the existing management system described below. Moreover, the authorities or courts may also change the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations at any time.

These differences in anticipation or failure to account for such changes in laws or regulations could result, for the group and its senior executives, in possible criminal, administrative or financial penalties, that could also lead, for the group, to a change in its capacity to carry out its operating activities, its revenues, its profits or its image.

Risk management

Concerning such legal and regulatory changes, Renault Group requires its subsidiaries to comply with the regulations of the countries in which the company conducts its business and takes

part

in ongoing discussions with the national or regional authorities in charge of the specific regulation of the products in the automotive sector, in order to anticipate changes and guarantee compliance of the Group with laws and regulations.

Renault Group also uses a structured approach to analyse and ensure the robustness of its regulatory compliance in a sustainable and proactive manner, within a scope of major regulated domains including: "competition", "anti- corruption", "environment", "health - safety - working environment", "technical regulations" and "data protection".

This approach is managed by the Ethics and Compliance Department, working closely with the Legal Department, under the supervision of the Ethics and Compliance

Committee (CEC). The maturity the regulatory compliance systems is measured quarterly by an index, a summary of which is presented to the CEC.

Renault Group is unable to assess the impact of ongoing litigation proceedings on the group.

In general, these proceedings could result in the payment of fines or damages that could have a negative impact on the group’s operating income and financial position. In this case, these proceedings could also have an effect on the group’s reputation among consumers and indirectly reduce the attractiveness of the vehicles that it markets.

As such, Renault Group files a significant number of patents, trademarks, designs and models in its area of activity each year (see chapter 1.3 of this document). The major risk facing Renault Group in terms of intellectual property is the

risk of counterfeiting, whether innocent or deliberate.

Counterfeiting may be committed by third parties against the products, industrial processes, brands, designs and models protected by Renault Group. From a technological standpoint, given Renault Group’s reputation, particularly in the field of hybrid and electric vehicles, the Group could become a prime target for such counterfeiting. Renault Group’s E-Tech technology is a significant example. As regards trademarks, designs and models, repercussions can be felt in particular in the replacement market. Renault

Risk management

The control of legal risks is in particular based on an internal control system organized around three guiding principles:

● Management of the group’s legal function, which is organized around a central function and employees in the group’s main countries. These employees report on a hierarchical and/or functional basis;

● Employees of the legal function are proactive in anticipating legal risks upstream and adapting the corresponding procedures

(advisory

consultations,

information from the central legal function, etc.);

● Regulatory monitoring by Renault Group in collaboration with the different countries concerned.

Renault Group Risk and control

4.2.5 Financial risks

Renault Group is exposed to the following six main risk components of a financial nature, the assessment, potential impacts and principles of control of which are specified below.

Foreign exchange risk

The international expansion of its activities leaves the Group exposed to foreign exchange risk. This risk is related to the fluctuation of the various currencies against the euro and mainly impacts the Group’s Automotive activity.

The Automotive segment is exposed to foreign exchange risk mainly in terms of its operating margin, and the Group may hedge some of its exposures from time to time. Based on the structure of its earnings and operating cash flows for 2022, a 1% rise in the euro against all currencies would have an unfavorable impact of 11 million euros on the annual operating margin of the Automotive segment after hedging (see note 25-B2 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact by currency).

The financial statements of the Group, its share in the profit or loss of associates, its shareholders' equity and its net liquidity position may also be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates against the euro. In particular, the Group has a 43.4% interest in Nissan, and therefore holds net yen assets whose fluctuations impact the value of the shares in assets and the Group's translation reserves in liabilities. For fiscal year 2022, the impact of a 1% rise in the euro against the yen would result in a decrease in Nissan's contribution to Group shareholders' equity of 167 million euros and to Group income from associates of

5 million euros (see notes 12-C and 25-B2 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, the Group partially hedges the foreign exchange risk associated with its investment in Nissan by borrowing in yen, which impacts its net liquidity position. A 1% rise in the euro against the yen would increase the net liquidity position by 14 million euros.

The Sales Financing segment is exposed to a more limited extent to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which may nevertheless have a negative impact on its financial position.

Risk management

The foreign exchange risk management policy for the Automotive segment is implemented and monitored by the Performance and

Control Department and the Financing and Treasury Department.

Any hedging of foreign exchange risk on operating margins must be analyzed in advance by the Performance and Control Department and the Financing and Treasury Department, and then formally authorized by the Finance Department or General Management, as well as reported

382

monthly to the Chief Financial Officer. Where possible, foreign exchange transactions are mainly carried out by the Group's trading room (Renault Finance) for currencies that can be tradedon international markets.

In 2022, in order to limit the exposure of its operating margin to currency risk, the Automotive segment has set up currency hedges on the Argentine peso, the Chinese yuan and the Turkish lira.

In addition, in order to avoid any currency-related distortion of financial results, the currency risk associated with financing and investment flows in foreign currencies is systematically minimized. Cash surpluses in countries not centralized at the parent company are generally invested in local currency under the supervision of the Treasury

Financing and Department. Financing transactions are carried out in the local currency of each entity, or when they are carried out in foreign currencies, are hedged in the same currency under the control of the

Treasury Department. Any residual Financing and

exposures (including those relating to Renault Finance operations) are subject to a waiver and are reported to the Chief Financial Officer on a monthly basis.

Equity investments (in currencies other than the euro) are generally not hedged, resulting

in translation adjustments, if any, which are recognized in Group shareholders' equity. However, given the size of the investment in Nissan, Renault's share of Nissan's net worth is partially hedged (see

note 12-G to the consolidated financial statements). In 2022, the Group amended its management policy whereby the hedging of its net investment in Nissan is limited to its best estimate of the next three years of yen dividends to be received from Nissan. The Group may now hedge a higher amount of its foreign exchange risk exposure on its share of equity in Nissan, subject to the yen share of Nissan's equity and its assessment of the liquidity risk on the yen.

The management of foreign exchange risk by the Sales Financing segment distinguishes between transactional and structural foreign exchange risk. With regard to transactional foreign exchange risk, most Sales financing subsidiaries operate in a single currency and are therefore not exposed to foreign exchange risk. However,

in some subsidiaries finance assets denominated different currencies. Their transactional foreign exchange position is subject to limits, and the residual exposure is kept to a marginal level for RCI Banque. At December 31, 2022, the RCI Banque group's consolidated transactional foreign exchange position (excluding investments in subsidiaries)

amounted to 1.2 billion euros. These investments are of strategic importance to RCI Banque and are included in the Group's risk management. They generate structural exposure to foreign exchange risk, which is managed with two main objectives: a) to protect the Group's consolidated capital ratios from the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates; b) to comply with local regulatory requirements in terms of capital ratios, with an appropriate cushion. Open positions may result in

asset losses (write-downs of equity) if the currency concerned depreciates. RCI Banque has established limits on the maximum loss realized by maintaining these open positions. For further

details of

the

foreign exchange risk management system, see note 25-B2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity risk

The Group finances its Automotive and Sales Financing activities through long-term debt issues, bank loans, commercial paper issues, as well as through receivables securitization and deposit-taking activities. In the event of a prolonged market closure or tension in access to credit, the Group is exposed to liquidity risk. If the Group cannot access new sources of financing or if its financing needs increase, insufficient

liquidity would

be particularly detrimental to its competitiveness, operating results and financial position. Liquidity risk is the risk that the automotive and sales financing segments will have reduced liquidity to repay debts as they mature or to finance balance sheet growth. The Group's liquidity could be significantly affected by factors beyond its control, such as general market disruptions, market perceptions of increased liquidity risk, or speculative pressures in the debt market.

The Automotive and Sales Financing segments are also subject to financial ratings from several agencies. Any downgrading of these ratings could limit and/or increase access to capital markets for these sectors of the Group. Under current market conditions, a possible downgrading of the financial rating of Renault S.A. (automotive sector) by Moody's would lead to a downgrading of the rating of RCI Banque (sales financing sector).

Risk management

Liquidity risk management in the Automotive segment is conducted by the Financing and Treasury Department. This management is based on an internal model, which defines the level of liquidity reserve to be maintained by the Automotive segment in order to finance its activity and development. This level of liquidity reserve is closely monitored on a monthly basis through periodic reviews and reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.

04

In 2022, Renault S.A. maintained its access to capital markets by issuing a "Samurai" bond. This bond was issued at the end of June 2022 for a nominal amount of 80.7 billion yen and a maturity of three years. Renault S.A. also maintained its access to

short-term financing through its NEU CP program.

In addition, in 2022, Renault S.A. prepaid €1 billion of the 4 billion euros initially drawn down in 2020 under the bank credit agreement guaranteed by the French State. As a reminder, this credit agreement for an initial amount of 5 billion euros was put in place in 2020 to finance the liquidity needs generated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The facility, which can be drawn down until December 31, 2020, was drawn down three times in the second half of 2020 for a total amount of 4 billion euros. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding nominal amount under

this

agreement was 1 billion euros.

The contractual documentation for Renault SA's financing, including bank financing and credit agreements, does not contain any clause that could call into question the maintenance of credit due to changes in the quality of Renault Group's signature or compliance with financial ratios.

At December 31, 2022, the Automotive segment had a liquidity reserve of 17.7 billion euros. This liquidity reserve is significantly above the internal target and enables the Automotive segment to meet its 12-month commitments. It is made up of 14.2 billion euros in cash and cash equivalents, and 3.4 billion euros in confirmed bank credit agreements, which were not used at December 31, 2022.

Liquidity risk management for the Sales Financing segment is based on several indicators or analyses, updated monthly on the basis of the latest forecasts for outstandings and refinancing transactions. Conservative assumptions are made

regarding deposit runoff. The Group has limits governing its liquidity risk. RCI Banque must at all times have sufficient financial resources to ensure the continuity of its business and its development. At December 31, 2022, RCI Banque's liquidity reserve

(Europe) stood at 14 billion euros. The liquidity reserve remains significantly above internal targets. It is made up of 4.4 billion euros of undrawn confirmed bank lines, 4.6 billion euros of collateral eligible for Central Bank monetary policy operations, 5.8 billion euros of highly liquid assets (HQLA) and 0.2 billion euros of available cash. These enable assets

RCI Banque to the maintain financing granted to its customers for further 12 months without access to external liquidity.

Renault Group Risk and control

Customer and network

credit risk

In its sales financing business, the Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its retail and business customers and the dealer network. Credit risk arises from the uncertainty that the customer (debtor) will be able to meet its obligations to repay the debt it has contracted with RCI Banque.

Credit risk can be broken down into the risk of default, i.e. the probability that a client will not meet its obligations to pay, and the risk of loss in the event of default, i.e. the non- repayment of the debt at the time of default. The assessment of these two components of credit risk is linked to the socio-economic and financial elements of the debtor and to the macroeconomic and microeconomic context in which the debtor is found.

Hence, the level of credit risk is expressed in terms of the classification of loans according to their level of risk (classification into three stages in accordance with IFRS9 ) and in terms of the level of impairment applied to each risk class (stage). Impairment charges on loans and losses are recognized annually and presented in RCI Banque's income statement under the "cost of risk" accounting aggregate. The level of the annual cost of risk thus expresses the marginal increase or decrease in credit risk on the customer loan portfolio.

The cost of risk on the Client and Network activity (individual and corporate financing) is marked by a return to normal after a very low level observed in 2021 in a more favorable economic context. Credit quality at origination has been maintained (tightening of acceptance policies) as has collection performance.

Risk management

RCI Banque's acceptance system is based on statistical models for granting loans, acceptance rules designed to protect our of

customers against

the risk overindebtedness, the use of external databases to check the overall indebtedness of our customers (except in France, where there is no "positive" file), and measures to combat fraud. In addition, for financing to the dealership network, RCI Banque has an internal methodology for rating each counterparty on a risk scale.

In addition, all acceptance procedures are governed by Group standards transposed by each RCI Banque Group entity. The quality of credit risk at the outset and throughout the life of the loan is constantly monitored, and a specific governance structure has been set up to ensure that the credit risk monitoring system is consistent. Within this framework, provision adjustments are made for fragile customer segments or risk deterioration factors such as inflation that has already occurred.

Lastly, in a forward-looking management approach, RCI Banque makes upward adjustments to the amount of impairment on its outstanding customer loans using the forward looking technique, taking into account unfavorable economic scenarios, and also measures the

384

resilience of its business model and capital adequacy by applying a stress test to its customer loan portfolio.

The total cost of risk at December 31, 2022, was 0.44% of

average earning assets with 0.14% at compared December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, net assets of customers amounted to 39,063 million euros and net assets of dealers to 10,429 million euros.

For further details on the customer and network credit risk management system, see note 25-B6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Risk of exposure to residual values

A downward trend in the market for used vehicles may result in a risk for the holder of the residual values, who undertakes to take back the vehicles at the end of their financing at a price fixed at the inception of the contracts. This risk could have a negative impact on the company's operating results and financial position due to the recognition of losses not anticipated at the inception of

the contract. However, the situation in 2022 is very favorable, with an increase in the market price of used vehicles and an improvement in the residual values of our entire range.

The risk of a decline in residual values is borne by the Group's automotive activities and by Mobilize Financial Services for financing associated with a vehicle trade-in commitment.

At December 31, 2022, the Renault Group's exposure to changes in residual values on the market amounted to 2,816 million euros for Automobile (net book value of vehicles) and 2,506 million euros for Mobilize Financial Services (value of the trade-in commitment in financing contracts). At December 31, 2021, the exposure amounted to 3,121 million euro and 2,110 million euro respectively. The decrease in exposure for the automotive division is explained by the sale of Retail Renault Group car dealerships in France and Europe. The increase in Mobilize Financial Services is attributable to business in the United Kingdom, where contract volumes have increased (better commercial performance) as have vehicle residual values.

Risk management

Developments in the used vehicle market are periodically and thoroughly monitored by the Renault Group Residual Value Committee, which analyzes, among other things, used vehicle sales volumes, their current and future market prices, the sales channel mix and the new sales prices of these same vehicles. The result is an estimate of risk, and provisions may be made on a conservative basis on the loan portfolio when the market values observed have fallen below the level of trade-in commitments, or if specific future risks have been identified in the used car market.

RCI Banque has equivalent governance and benefits from significant synergies with the parent company in terms of tools and information.

Interest rate risk

Exposure to interest rate risk relates mainly to the sales financing segment, where this risk represents the impact of a change in interest rates on the future gross financial margin. RCI Banque's operating results may be affected by changes in market interest rates or in the rates charged on customer deposits.

Risk management

Interest rate risk for the Sales Financing segment is managed on a daily basis: sensitivity is calculated by currency, by management entity and by asset portfolio to ensure that each entity complies with the individual limits set for it. The sensitivity to interest rate risk is measured using a common methodology for all RCI Banque entities. Sensitivity consists of measuring the impact of an increase in interest rates on the value of balance sheet flows for each entity. The magnitude of the increase depends on the currency. It is 100 bp for EUR, CHF, KRW, 15P bp for GBP, 200 bp for PLN, RON, COP, and 300 bp for BRL. The hedging system reduces RCI Banque's overall

exposure as

well

as

the exposure of

each

entity. At December 31, 2022, after hedging, the sum of the absolute values of sensitivities to a parallel rate shock in each currency amounted to 5.7 million euros, below the limit set by the Group (70 million euros).

For the Automotive segment, liquidity reserves are generally built up at variable rates and long-term investments are financed at fixed rates. The Automobile segment's available cash is centralized, as far as possible, at Renault S.A., and placed in short-term bank deposits by Renault Finance.

Like several other manufacturers, Renault Group has been the target of a judicial investigation for aggravated deception since 2017. This case follows the investigation conducted by the DGCCRF into the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) of a dozen car manufacturers selling diesel vehicles in France. In this case, joined by fewer than 20 complainants, Renault Group was charged with deception on 8 June 2021. As per this status, the company is presumed innocent.

Renault Group denies having committed any offence and points out that its vehicles are not equipped with any rigging software for pollution control devices. The company takes all necessary measures to preserve its rights.

At this stage, Renault Group has had to post a bond of €20 million (€18 million of which will be dedicated to the potential payment of damages and fines) and provide a €60 million bank guarantee dedicated to the potential compensation forlosses.

International Also on the matter of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, Renault Group has been the target of civil actions for damages in

various countries for allegedly equipping its vehicles with rigging software for pollution control devices.

In Germany, for example, 44 cases are under way against Renault Group. 21 first-instance decisions and six appeals court decisions have already been handed down. All of them were in Renault Group's favour.

In Austria, seven civil proceedings are under way.

In the UK, threatened class actions brought by three law firms, in which some very preliminary procedural steps have been taken, are currently being brought by two of them (following the withdrawal of the third) against Renault Group and certain authorized dealers.

Lastly, three Dutch foundations have initiated legal proceedings against Renault S.A., Renault S.A.S., Renault Nederland NV, Renault-Nissan BV and Automobile Dacia S.A. in the Netherlands, as well as certain authorized dealers. This case is currently at a preliminary stage.

Antitrust investigations on end-of-life vehicles

On 15 March 2022, the European Commission conducted inspections at the premises of

companies and several

associations active in the automotive sector located in

EU Member States. In parallel, the European Commission has sent out formal requests for information to several companies active in the automotive sector. investigation concerns possible anticompetitive collusion in relation to the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life (ELV) cars and vans, relating in particular to (i) the compensation of ELV collection, treatment, and recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in advertising materials.

The

Renault was one of the companies visited on 15 March 2022. In parallel, Renault has received a request for information from the

UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is investigating similar conduct. Renault has replied to the European Commission’s and the CMA’s requests for information.

04

Tax risk is the risk associated with changes in tax laws or regulations, differences in interpretation with local tax authorities and changes in tax jurisprudence.

Each of the known disputes or ongoing proceedings in which the group is involved was reviewed as of the balance sheet date, possibly with the assistance of external advisers, and provisions have been established to coverthe estimated risks where appropriate.

There are currently significant disputes with the tax authorities in France, Spain and South Korea, mainly on transfer pricing issues.

The group disputes the arguments put forward by the tax authorities and has initiated dispute proceedings to assert its position.

The group considers that it has a solid case for asserting its rights.

● Renault Megane E-Tech Electric reached

over 33,000 sales in 2022, since its launch at the end of 2022 Q2. It was number 1 EV in France in 2022 H2. As of today, 49,000 orders have been recorded since its launch with more than 70% of these on the highest versions and more than 80% on the most powerful engines;

● acceleration of the pricing effect, which reached +9.7 pts on the Automotive revenue vs 2021 (+12.1 pts in 2022 H2 after +7.4 pts in 2022 H1), thanks to the Renaulution commercial policy.

Reminder relative to the impacts of the disposal of Russian automotive activities on financial statements:

In May 2022, the Board of Directors of Renault Group unanimously approved the signing of agreements to sell 100% of Renault Group’s shares in Renault Russia to the City of Moscow and its 67.69% stake in Avtovaz to NAMI (the Central Institute for Research and Development of Automobiles and Engines). In addition, the agreement provides for a call option for Renault Group to buy back its stake in Avtovaz, exercisable at certain periods over the next 6 years.

As a result of these agreements :

● the Russian activities were deconsolidated in Renault Group’s 2022 financial statements and treated as discontinued operations under IFRS 5 with retroactive effect from January 1st , 2022;

information

Financial statements

● the financial aggregates of continuing operations for 2022 therefore no longer include the Russian industrial activities and the year 2021 has been adjusted in line with this new scope of activity;

● the result of discontinued operations represents a loss of -€2.3 billion in 2022, mainly due to the impairment of the property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill of Avtovaz and Renault Russia as well as the impairment of specific assets held by the other entities of the Group and the result of disposals on the Russian entities sold;

05

● the Automotive net debt was reduced by €0.5 billion from -€1.6 billion to -€1.1 billion at December 31, 2021.

Group revenue reached €46,391 million, up 11.4% compared to 2021. At constant exchange rates3

, it increased by 12.4% (-1 point of negative exchange rates effect).

Automotive revenue stood at €43,121 million, up 11.4% compared to 2021. At constant exchange rates1, it increased by 12.6% (-1.2 points of negative exchange rates effect mainly related to the Turkish lira and Argentinean peso devaluation).

Volume effect

stood at +3.4 points thanks to the commercial success of vehicles coupled with an improved availability of EC components. Invoices outperformed sales because of delays in the delivery of vehicles ordered by and invoiced to the independent dealers to answer their customers’ demand. These delays were due to outbound logistic tensions at the end of the year.

The price effect, positive by +9.7 points, reflected the continuation of the Group’s commercial policy, launched in 2020 Q3, focused on value over volume, as well as price increases to offset cost inflation, and an optimization of commercial discounts. It amounted to +12.1 points in 2022 H2 after +7.4 points in H1.

The success of Renault Megane E-Tech Electric launched at the end of 2022 Q2, Renault Arkana launched in 2021 Q2, as well as Dacia Jogger launched in 2022 Q1, evidenced the renewal and the offensive of Renault and Dacia brands in the C-segment. It generated in 2022 a +2.8 points positive product mix effect.

The impact of sales to partners, negative by -1.4 points, was mainly due to the decrease in production of diesel engines and vehicles for Renault Group’s partners (end of contracts of Master for Opel and Traffic for Fiat at the end of 2021).

The “Others” effect, of -1.8 points, was due to a decrease in the contribution of sales from the Renault Retail Group (RRG) network following the disposals of branches and lower sales of used cars, partially offset by strong performance in the aftersales activity.

The Group recorded a positive operating margin of €2,59 million (5.6% of revenue) versus €1,153 million (2.8% of and

revenue) in 2021 (+€1,442 million +2.8 points). It improved sequentially to 6.4% in 2022 H2 versus 4.7% in 2022 H1.

Financial statements

Automotive operating margin stood at €1,402 million (3.3% of Automotive revenue) versus -€3 million

in 2021 (+3.3 points).

The positive mix/price/enrichment effect +€3,539 million illustrated the success of the commercial policy focused on value over volume. It largely offset the increase in costs which amounted to -€2,288 million. The latter was mainly explained by the impact of inflation on raw materials (-€1,916 million), on purchasing costs, and on manufacturing and logistic costs, despite continuous productivity gains. The volume effect stood

of

at

+€199 million.

The contribution of Mobilize Financial Services (Sales Financing) to the Group's operating margin reached €1,223 million, up €38 million compared to 2021. It was positively impacted by non-recurring impacts on the swaps valuation mainly coming from the interest rate increase in Europe and by the focus on the most profitable customer channels bringing higher margins.

The 6.4% decrease of the number of new financing contracts in retail business, mainly linked to the evolution of Group’s registrations, was more than offset by the 10.4% increase in the average financed amount. Thus, new financings increased by 3.3% versus 2021.

Other operating income and expenses were negative at -€379 million (versus -€253 million in 2021) and were mostly explained by restructuring provisions for -€354 million and impairments for -€257 million mainly related to a Chinese facility, partially offset by asset disposals (+€202 million) related to the sale of several commercial subsidiaries of the Group and branches of RRG, in line with the announced strategy.

After taking into account other operating income and expenses, the Group’s operating income stood at €2,216 million versus €900 million in 2021 (+€1,316 million versus 2021).

Net financial income and to

expenses amounted -€486 million compared to -€295 million in 2021. Most of this deterioration is explained by the accounting impact of hyperinflation in Argentina despite the decrease in financial interests on the net debt.

The contribution of associated companies amounted to €423 million compared to €515 million in 2021. This included €526 million related to Nissan's contribution, which more than offset the negative contribution from other associates (-€103 million), notably in connection with the impairment of Renault Nissan Bank shares in Russia.

Current and deferred taxes represented a charge of -€533 million compared to a charge of -€571 million in 2021. The increase linked to the improvement of the pretax income was more than offset by net year-over-year one- offs.

Net income from continuing operations was €1,620 million, up €1,071 million compared to 2021. Net income from continuing operations, Group share, was €1,650 million (or €6.07 per share).

Net income from discontinued operations amounted to -€2,320 million due to the non-cash adjustment related to the disposals of the Russian industrial activities.

Thus, net income was -€700 million and net income, Group share, was -€338 million (or -€1.24 per share).

The cash flow of the Automotive business reached €4,818 million, up €519 million compared to 2021 (including €800 million of Mobilize Financial Services dividend

versus €1,000 million in 2021). This cash flow largely covered the tangible and intangible investments before asset disposals which amounted to €2.5 billion (€2.1 billion net of disposals) and the

restructuring expenses (-€590 million).

Excluding the impact of asset disposals, the Group's net CAPEX and R&D amounted to €3,451 million in 2022 (7.4% of revenue) stable compared to 2021 (€3,579 million and 8.6% of revenue).

Automotive operational free cash flow4 was positive at +€2,119 million taking into account a positive change in working capital requirement of +€7 million.

As of December 31, 2022, total inventories of new vehicles (including the independent dealer network) represented 480,000 vehicles compared to 336,000 at the end of December 2021. This increase is explained by higher independent dealers’ inventories notably due to outbound logistic tensions at the end of the year. This level of inventories has to be put into perspective with the record level of the orderbook.

The Automotive financial position is now positive at +€549 million on December 31, 2022, compared to -€1,100 million adjusted from the operations of Avtovaz and Renault Russia at December 31, 2021, an improvement of €1.6 billion.

In 2022, Renault Group made an early repayment of €1 billion and reimbursed €1 billion for the mandatory annual repayment of the loan of a banking pool benefiting from the guarantee of the French State (PGE). As announced, the entire loan will be reimbursed by the end of 2023 at the latest.

Group revenue reached €46,391 million, up 11.4% compared to 2021. At constant exchange rates11, it increased by 12.4% (-1 point of negative exchange rate effect).

Automotive revenue stood at €43,121 million, up 11.4% compared to 2021. At constant exchange rates1 , increased by 12.6% (-1.2 points of negative exchange rates effect mainly related to the Turkish lira and Argentinean peso devaluation).

it

Volume effect

stood at +3.4 points thanks to the commercial success of vehicles coupled with an improved availability of EC components. Invoices outperformed sales because of delays in the delivery of vehicles ordered by and invoiced to the independent dealers to answer their customers’ demand. These delays were due to outbound logistic tensions at the end of the year.

The price effect, positive by +9.7 points, reflected the continuation of the Group’s commercial policy, launched in 2020 Q3, focused on value over volume, as well as price increases to offset cost inflation, and an optimization of

commercial discounts. It amounted to +12.1 points in 2022 H2 after +7.4 points in H1.

The success of Renault Megane E-Tech Electric launched at the end of 2022 Q2, Renault Arkana launched in 2021 Q2, as well as Dacia Jogger launched in 2022 Q1, evidenced the renewal of Renault and Dacia brands’ offensive in the C-segment. It generated in 2022 a +2.8 points positive product mix effect.

The impact of sales to partners, negative by -1.4 points, was mainly due to the decrease in production of diesel engines and vehicles for Renault Group’s partners (end of contracts of Master for Opel and Traffic for Fiat at the end of 2021).

The “Others” effect, of -1.8 points, was due to a decrease in the contribution of sales from the Renault Retail Group (RRG) network following the disposals of branches and lower sales of used cars, partially offset by strong performance in the aftersales activity.

11 In order to analyze the variation in consolidated revenue at constant exchange rates, Renault Group recalculates the revenue for the current period by applying average exchange rates of the previous period.

The Group recorded a positive operating margin of €2,595 million (5.6% of revenue) versus €1,153 million (2.8% of revenue) in 2021 (+€1,442 million and +2.8 points). It improved sequentially to 6.4% in 2022 H2 versus 4.7% in 2022 H1.

Automotive operating margin stood at €1,402 million (3.3% of Automotive revenue) versus -€3 million in 2021 (+3.3 points).

The positive mix/price/enrichment effect of +€3,539 million illustrated the success of the commercial policy focused on value over volume. It largely offset the increase in costs which amounted to -€2,288 million. The latter was mainly explained by the impact of inflation on raw materials (- €1,916 million), on purchasing costs, and on manufacturing

and logistic costs, despite continuous productivity gains. The volume effect stood at +€199 million.

The contribution of Mobilize Financial Services (Sales Financing) to the Group's operating margin reached €1,223 million, up €38 million compared to 2021. It was positively impacted by non-recurring impacts on the swaps valuation mainly coming from the interest rate increase in Europe and by the focus on the most profitable customer channels bringing higher margins.

The 6.4% decrease of the number of new financing contracts in retail business, mainly linked to the evolution of Group’s registrations, was more than offset by the 10.4% increase in the average financed amount. Thus, new financings increased by 3.3% versus 2021.

In a context of renewal of the line-up, particularly electric, in the C-segment and for commercial vehicle, the moderate decrease in research and

development expenses in 2022 was explained by fixed cost reduction actions. The level of capitalization of development costs increased compared to 2021 in connection with the renewal cycle ofthe line-up.

Amortization of capitalized

development costs decreased compared to 2021 and was lower than the capitalization of development costs in 2022, mainly due to the decrease in capitalization in previous years and the extension of the life of some programs.

5.2.1 Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements

Forthe year ended December 31, 2022

To the Annual General Meeting of Renault,

Opinion

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Renault for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with the report the Audit and Risks Committee.

Basis for Opinion

Audit Framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1st, 2022 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.

Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements ofthe current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of long-term assets of the Automotive sectors

Risk identified Intangible and tangible assets and goodwill, of the “Automotive” operating segment amount to 15 566 million euros as of December 31, 2022.

The Group carries out impairmenttests on assets as soon as an impairment risk indicator has been identified, and at least once a year for assets with infinite useful life, under the approach described in note 2-M of the consolidated financial statements.

The test consists in comparing the net book value of assets with their recoverable value, defined as the higher amount between the value in use and the fair value net of exit costs. The value in use is calculated based on discounted future cash flows. When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value,the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in the assets concerned.

For 2022 year-end closing, these impairment tests consider the assumptions used in the update of the Renaulution medium-term plan.

In addition, the perpetuity growth rates used in the tests as of December 31, 2022 take into account the impacts of the commitments made by the signatory States of the Paris agreements on climate change.

We have considered that the valuation of assets is a key audit matter because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the estimates and judgments required from Management to prepare these tests, particularly in the current context described above.

Our audit

response

During our audit ofthe consolidated financial statements, our procedures mainly consisted in:

● understanding the analysis performed by Management in order to identify impairment indicators

●

for assets tested:

● reconciling the net book value of assets to the consolidated financial statements;

● assessing the consistency ofthe data on projected volumes and margins used in the tests with the latest management estimates presented in the updated Renaulution medium-term plan, which reflects the negative effects due to the component crisis and the impacts of the commitments made by the signatory States of the Paris agreements on climate change;

● in particular, verify that these data take into account the separation of certain mechanical activities of Renault Group known as HORSE, as announced at the Capital Market Day on November 8, 2022, the corresponding assets and liabilities of which have been reclassified in the consolidated statement of financial position on December 31, 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5 "Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations";

● assessing, in the context described above, the reasonableness of the main assumptions used through interviews with management and by comparing the assumptions with the data used in the previous impairment tests, with the historical performance or with external market data;

● testing the arithmetical accuracy of the discounted cash flows projections prepared by management.;

● comparing the discount rate after tax used with external data available;

● performing sensitivity analysis on the main assumptions used.

Consolidation method and recoverable value of the equity investment of Renault in Nissan

Risk identified As of December 31, 2022, the Renault equity investment in Nissan amounts to 17 487 million euros, and Nissan’s contribution to Renault’s net income corresponds to a gain of 526 million euros.

05

As indicated in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, Renault has a significant influence over Nissan and accounts for its investment using the equity method. Nissan’s accounts used to prepare Renault’s financial statements are Nissan’s consolidated accounts published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards, adjusted according to IFRS standards for consolidation purposes. In accordance with the approach described in the accounting rules and methods (note 2-M), an impairment test of the investment in Nissan was carried out on December 31, 2022.

We have considered that the consolidation method and recoverable value of the equity investment in Nissan is a key audit matter given its magnitude to Renault’s consolidated financial statements, and given the following areas of attention: (1) the judgment of management to assess the Alliance governance structure as well as facts and circumstances underlying Renault’s significant influence over Nissan, (2) the completeness of adjustments to Nissan’s financial statements required to account for Renault’s share in the result and equity of this company and their accuracy, (3) the estimates used by management in determining the recoverable value of Renault’s investment in Nissan.

Our audit response

Our audit response to the risks identified mainly consisted in:

● reading the minutes of the Board of Directors meetings and the related party agreements and commitments register and obtaining confirmation from managementthat there were no changes in the governance of Nissan and of the Alliance and/or no new contracts structuring the relations between Renault and Nissan which could modify the analysis of the significant influence exercised by Renault over Nissan at closing date;

● understanding the conclusions and the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan in accordance with our instructions which detail the procedures to be performed and the conclusion format required for our audit purposes;

● understanding the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan over the homogenization adjustments required to Nissan’s financial statements to match with Renault accounting policies;

● assessing whether there are any identified impairment indicators, the main indicators being significant adverse changes on markets where Nissan operates or a significant and long lasting drop in Nissan stock market value;

● examining the relevance of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable value of its investment in Nissan, by reference to Nissan mid-term plan, historical performance achieved by Nissan as well as the overall perspectives of the Automotive sector;

● assessing the appropriateness ofthe information provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Calculation of expected credit losses on retail and wholesale receivables in accordance with the new accounting standard IFRS 9

Risk identified The sales financing activity is managed by RCI Banque with dedicated offers for individuals and companies as well as the financing of dealer networks.

RCI Banque sets aside provisions to cover the risk of losses resulting from the inability of its clients to meet their financial commitments. RCI Banque applies the accounting principles of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” which defines a provisioning model for expected losses based on three stages ofrisk: healthy receivables (stage 1), receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition (stage 2), and receivables in default (stage 3).

The provisions related to IFRS 9 are detailed in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements and amounts to 1 111 M€ for an outstanding amount of 45 358 M€.

We consider the amount of credit loss provisioning as a key point of the audit, due to the significant amount of customer and network loans in the assets of the Group's balance sheet, the use of numerous parameters and assumptions in the calculation models and the use of judgment made by management in estimating expected credit losses. As mentioned in the note 2-B, those assumptions are even more important in the current situation which brings major economic uncertainties in the world for the years to come.

Our audit

response

Our procedures, performed with our specialists, mainly consisted in:

● assessing the key controls related to the governance established to validate the changes in parameters and key assumptions involved in the calculation of the expected credit loss

● assessing the methodologies applied to set the parameters used in the provisioning models and their operational integration in the information systems;

● assessing the provisioning adjustments made on expertise at local and Group levels;

● examining the documentation supporting the additional provisioning booked;

● assessing the models and assumptions used in the determination of the “forward looking” component, in particular the weighting of the various scenarios used;

● testing the quality of the application program interfaces that support the calculation and accounting of the expected credit losses;

● evaluating the staging process;

● ensuring the completeness and the quality of the data used in the estimation of the provisioning;

● carrying out analytical procedures on the evolution of outstanding retail customer and dealer network loans and credit risk impairment;

● assessing the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued operations in relation with Renault Group exit from Russia

Risk identified As indicated in the notes 2-B “Estimations and judgments”, 3-A “Changes in the scope of consolidation” and 3-B “Discontinued operations” the Group sold its affiliate Renault Russia on May 15, 2022 to the city of Moscow, as well as its 67,69 % shareholding of Lada Auto Holding, parent company of AVTOVAZ (hereafter “AVTOVAZ”) to NAMI (Central Institute for Research and Development of Automobiles and Engines )for a sale price of 1ruble for each transaction, with an option for Renault Group to buy back its stake in AVTOVAZ, exercisable at certain periods overthe next six years.

05

The signing of these agreements led to the deconsolidation of these entities and their classification as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 over 2022, with the corresponding restatement of the income statement and cash flow statement for comparative figures relating to 2021.

At December 31, 2022, impairment losses recognized on intangible and tangible assets, related to discontinued operations, income for the period from these operations, income from the sale of Renault Russia and AVTOVAZ shares (including the recycling of translation adjustments to P&L) and the effects of these disposals (in particular, the waiver of receivables, the repayment of part of Renault Russia’s financial debt and write-downs of inventories dedicated to vehicles marketed in the Russian Federation) have been isolated on the line ”Income from discontinued operations”, in application of IFRS 5. Sales made by Group companies to Russian entities have also been classified as discontinued operations with corresponding restatement of 2021 data. Consolidated cash flow items from Renault Russia, AVTOVAZ and its subsidiaries, as well as the sales made by Group companies to Russian entities and the impairment of assets located outside the Russian Federation but whose loss of value is the direct consequence of the Group’s exit from the Russian Federation, were also classified as discontinued operations. The data related to the 2021 financial years have also been restated accordingly.

The result of discontinued operations for 2022 amounts to 2 320 M€ in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, including an impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill in the Russian Federation of 2 221 M€. Details of this result from discontinued operations are provided in note 3-B to the consolidated financial statements. For the comparative year 2021, net income has been restated by 418 M€ for the full year in respect of discontinued operations.

We considered thatthe accounting treatment of the sale by the Renault Russia Group and its shareholding in Lada Auto Holding is a key audit matter due to its significant nature and the estimates and judgments of management necessary to evaluate all the accounting impacts in terms of impairment and presentation.

Our audit response

In the context of our audit of the Group’s consolidated financial statements, our work consisted mainly of:

● assessing on the basis of the documents obtained, the Group’s analysis of the loss of control of the activities in the Russian Federation;

● assessing the appropriateness of the classification of the disposal of Renault Russia and Lada Auto Holding with regard to the provisions of IFRS 5, in particular through interviews with Group management, analysis of the minutes of the Board of Directors and the available documentation, as well as the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions on which the classification as discontinued operations is based;

● review the procedures put in place by the Group to identify the impacts of Renault Group’s exit from the Russian Federation by

interviewing those in charge within the Group and assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine these impacts;

● verify the arithmetical accuracy ofthe calculations made by the company, in particular to determine the amount of impairment and the result of disposal;

● corroborate, on a test basis, the figures for discontinued operations presented in the income statement, the cash flow statement, the consolidated comprehensive income and in the note 3-B with the information used to prepare the consolidated financial statements;

● assess the appropriateness of the disclosures in notes 2-B “Estimates and judgments”, 3-B “Discontinued operations” and 28-B “Off- balance sheet commitments received, contingent assets and assets received as collateral” to the financial statements concerning the option to repurchase the Avtovaz shares.

Specific Verifications

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group’s information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), is included in the Group’s information given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823‑10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and the information must be reported by an independent third party.

Report on Other legal and Regulatory Requirements

Format of presentation ofthe consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report

We have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in article L451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code monétaire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Renault S.A Chief executive, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.

Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.

Due to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Furthermore, we have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.

Appointment ofthe Statutory Auditors

We were appointed as statutory auditors of Renault by the Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2014 for KPMG S.A. and on June 19, 2020 for MAZARS.

As of December 31, 2022, KPMG S.A. was in the nineth year of total uninterrupted engagement and MAZARS in the third year.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.

The Audit and Risks Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financialreporting procedures.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Objectives and audit approach

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

● Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

● Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.

● Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

● Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided orinadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

05

● Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

● Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

Reportto the Audit and Risks Committee

We submit to the Audit and Risks Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal controlregarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit, Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this audit report.

We also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risks Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

5.2.2.6.1. Information on operating segments and Regions

From January 1, 2022, following the disposal of Renault’s investment in Avtovaz, the operating segments used by Renault Group are as follows:

● The “Automotive” segment, which comprises the production, sales, and distribution subsidiaries for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, and the

cash subsidiaries in charge of the segment’s

management. This segment also includes investments in automotive-sector associates and

joint ventures, principally Nissan.

● The “Sales Financing” segment, which the Group considers as an operating activity in its own right, carried out network and for the distribution final

customers by RCI Banque, its subsidiaries and its associates and joint ventures.

●

The “Mobility Services” segment consisting of services

for new mobilities.

The segment previously named Avtovaz, and all the discontinued operations in Russia, are now presented separately as Discontinued operations in the Automotive segment in 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5. The segment information for 2021 has been adjusted according to the same principles.

The segment result regularly reviewed by the Board of Management, identified as the “Chief Operating Decision- Maker”, is the operating margin. The definition of this indicator is detailed in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022 (Note 2-D Presentation of the consolidated financial statements). The operating margin excludes restructuring costs.

5.2.2.6.2. Accounting policies and scope of consolidation

Note 1

Approval of the financial statements

Renault Group’s consolidated financial statements for 2022 were examined at the Board of Directors’ meeting of February 15, 2023 and will be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting.

Note 2

Accounting policies

In application of European regulations, the Renault Group’s consolidated financial statements for 2022 are prepared under IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as issued by the lASB (International Accounting Standards Board) at December 31, 2022 and adopted by the European Union at the year-end.

2-A. Changes in accounting policies

New amendments and improvements mandatory for 2022

Renault Group applies the accounting standards and amendments that have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union and are mandatory from January 1, 2022.

Amendments to IAS 16 Amendments to IFRS 3 Amendments to IAS 37 Annual improvements (2018-2020 cycle) Annual improvements process

Property, plant and equipment: Proceeds before intended use Updating a reference to the conceptual framework Onerous contracts – Cost of fulfilling a contract

Application ofthese amendments from January 1, 2022 has no significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.

The Group does not at this stage anticipate that application of the amendments to IAS 1, IAS 8 and IAS 12 will have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, published on May 18, 2017, and modified by amendments of June 25, 2020, sets out the principles of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for insurance contracts. It replaces IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and will be applicable for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

For the Group, IFRS 17 mainly applies to credit insurance contracts issued and reassurance agreements signed by the Sales Financing segment’s insurance companies. Contracts will be valued under the general “building block” approach which comprises: (1) estimated future cash flows discounted under the “bottom-up” approach,

with a discount rate determined by adjusting a risk-free yield curve to take account of liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts portfolio, (2) adjustment for non- financial risks calculated according to the confidence interval method, and (3) the contractual service margin. The contractual service margin will be recognized in the income statement based on the coverage units supplied during the period, i.e. according to the amortization of the insured credit.

The modified retrospective application of IFRS 17 from January 1, 2023, is expected to have a positive effect on equity around €130 million as of January 1, 2022, the transition date. No onerous contracts were identified in the portfolio at the transition date. Calculation of the impact of IFRS 17 on the 2022 income statement is not yet finalized.

IFRS IC interpretation concerning recognition of Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) (IFRS 9 and IAS 20)

The IFRS IC decision clarifying analysis and recognition of TLTRO III transactions became final in March 2022. This decision applies to drawings of TLTRO III financing by the Sales Financing segment, to which the Group has opted to apply IFRS 9. More details of these transactions are provided in Note 23-C.

2-B. Estimates and judgements

Specific context of 2022

Renault Group’s exit from the Russian Federation

As announced on May 16, 2022, Renault Group has sold its investments in Renault Russia and the Avtovaz Group. Those entities have therefore been deconsolidated. They are treated as discontinued operations in 2022, in compliance with IFRS 5, and the 2021 income statement and cash flow statement figures have been adjusted accordingly. Following this sale, the Avtovaz Group is no longer presented as a separate operating segment for the purposes of segment reporting.

Details of the impacts of this deconsolidation are provided in Note 3-B, Discontinued operations, and Renault Group’s option to buy back its investment in Avtovaz is mentioned in Note 28-B. Off-balance sheet commitments received, contingent assets and assets received as collateral.

In the Sales Financing segment, the Group fully consolidates one 100%- owned entity (RNL Leasing) and applies the equity method for RN Bank. Due to uncertainty over its recoverability the equity-accounted value of RN Bank is fully written off at December 31, 2022 (see Note 13), with a negative impact of € 119 million on the net income of associates and joint ventures for the year. The contribution by RNL Leasing to the Group’s shareholders’ equity remains of low significance (€2 million) and the €19 million shareholder loan is eliminated as an intragroup

Hyperinflation in Turkey

On March 16, 2022

Turkey was identified by the International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Center for Audit Quality as a country that should be considered hyperinflationary for the purposes of 2022 financial statements.

The entities MAIS Motorlu Araclar Imal ve Satis AS and ORFIN Finansman Anonim Sirketi, which are accounted for under the equity method, use the local currency as their functional and

currency applied have the hyperinflation adjustment at December 31, 2022. Its effect on their contribution to the Group financial statements is considered non-significant. The fully consolidated entities Oyak Renault and Renault Group Otomotiv prepare their accounts for the Group consolidation using the euro as their functional currency, since most of their business is conducted in euros. Consequently, their accounts do not require adjustment for hyperinflation.

operation. At December 31, 2022 this entity is classified as Assets held for sale at a book value that does not exceed its recoverable value.

Components supply crisis

Since 2021, the Automotive segment has experienced disruptions in supplies of electronic components that have affected the worldwide automotive sector. The effects of this components crisis continued during 2022, and the principal consequence was lower production output. As a result, after a 4.5% decrease between 2020 and 2021 to 2,696,401 units, sales volumes also declined by 5.9% between 2021 and 2022: 2,051,174 vehicles were sold in 2022, compared to an adjusted volume (excluding sales in Russia) of 2,179,562 vehicles sold in 2021.

External financing

To maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for its operations, in 2022 the Group issued two bonds the Japanese market as part of Renault’s Shelf Registration program, for a total of ¥290.7 billion. And the Group made €2,010 million repayment in 2022 its of State-guaranteed credit facility. The outstanding amount of this credit, which initially amounted to €4 billion, is €990 million at December 31, 2022. At the date of publication of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has sufficient cash and sources of financing to ensure continuity of operations for the next twelve months and has demonstrated its capacity to issue debt.

Financial statements

Changes in the Group’s organization

Since announcing its Renaulution plan in 2020, Renault Group has worked to transform its business and its organization. At the Capital Market Day held on November 8, 2022, it announced that some of its Horse project powertrain technologies were to be combined into a joint venture. The groups of assets and liabilities concerned were therefore reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale in financial at

the consolidated position

December 31, 2022, in accordance with IFRS 5.

The Group also announced at the same Capital Market Day that it was setting up five targeted businesses with specialist teams, each one founded on a homogeneous set of technologies with its own governance and results. The practical results of this announcement will be visible from 2023 as the entities concerned are formed or sold off, and

it has no impact on the structure of segment reporting for 2022.

In November 2022, the Group sold 34% of the capital of its Korean subsidiary RKM to the Chinese group Geely, and

purchased an industrial production simultaneously

licence to make two new vehicles forthe Asian market

Employee agreements and employee shareholding

Amid rising inflation, discussions took place between the Management and the Unions about purchasing power

concerns in France. An agreement was signed on September 30, 2022, comprising several measures implemented in 2022 (a €500 bonus, a 25% increase in monetized unused leave, etc).

To engage all employees in the Group’s new strategy and future performance as in-depth changes are being made,

Renault Group launched Renaulution Shareplan, an employee shareholding operation attributing 6 free shares to than

more across 22 countries. In 95,000 employees 21 countries, the plan also offers employees the opportunity to buy shares at a 30% discount. As the reference share price in the Renaulution Shareplan is set at €31.46, the discounted share price is €22.02. The cost of this plan has been recognized in the 2022 financial statements.

Principal estimates and judgments in the 2022 context

In the context of the Group’s exit from the Russian Federation, workforce reduction plans, the electronic components supply crisis, and inflation, the following items in the Group’s consolidated financial statements have been paid particular attention in 2022:

● potential impairment of fixed assets, particularly impairment on specific assets linked to vehicles and goodwill (see Note 11);

● the recoverable value of leased vehicles classified as

property, plant and equipment or inventories;

● investments in associates, notably Nissan and RN Bank (see Notes 12 and 13);

432 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

● impairment for expected credit losses concerning Sales Financing receivables (see Note 15);

● revenue recognition;

● determination of restructuring provisions (see Notes 6-A and 20);

● determination

of risks

associated

with distressed suppliers;

● determination of compliance with the requirements of IFRS 5 for reclassification of assets or groups of assets and liabilities held for sale and reporting them on specific lines in the balance sheet in the current assets and current liabilities (see Note 3-C);

● estimation of the costs associated with the Renaulution Shareplan employee shareholding plan introduced in December 2022.

Principal estimates and judgments relating to environmental matters and climate issues

The main estimates and judgments relating to climate and environmental questions are the following:

● estimation of the risks associated with the applicable regulations on

air pollution and CO2 of the CAFE “Corporate Average Fuel Economy” regulation, which fines automakers if they exceed the average threshold for CO2 emissions by European-registered vehicles in each calendar year, see Note 28);

emissions (specifically the potential impact

● estimation of the consequences of commitments made in connection with environmental and climate issues for the value of Renault Group assets and their useful lives. At this stage, no impact has been identified on either the useful lives or the recoverable value of our tangible and intangible assets. An analysis of the useful lives of production assets, particularly against the background of changing markets, the growing proportion of electric vehicles and the Group’s circular economy decisions (the “Re-factories” at Flins and Seville) is conducted at each annual closing: this had no significant impact on the financial statements for 2022;

● estimation of consequences

the

of contractual purchase commitments for renewable energy made in connection with environmental and climate issues covering periods of up to 15 years and involving substantial investments; the analysis focused on control of the assets and the financial terms of these contracts, and concluded that they contained no leases embedded derivatives; information is provided in 28-A1

or

Note on sheet commitments (minimum purchase commitments);

off-balance

● use of a growth rate to infinity for impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that incorporates the effects of commitments made by signatory States to the Paris Agreements on climate change. This has no impact, since the recoverable value of the assets concerned remains significantly higher than their book value.

Other important estimates and judgments

Renault Group often has to make estimates and assumptions that affect the book value of certain assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made in certain notes to the financial statements. In preparing its statements, Renault

financial Group regularly revises its estimates and assessments to take account of past experience and other factors deemed relevantin view of the economic circumstances.

It takes into consideration forecast technological and market developments (commodity costs, changing customer demand, etc) and any other developments that could have a significant impact on the consolidated statements in

financial application of IFRS rules. If changes in these assumptions or circumstances are not as anticipated, the figures reported in Renault Group’s future consolidated financial statements could differ from the estimates established at the time these financial statements were finalized. The main items in the Group’s consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022

2-C. Consolidation principles

The consolidated

financial statements

include the financial statements of all companies controlled exclusively by the Group either directly or indirectly (subsidiaries). Jointly controlled companies are accounted for under the equity method when they are classified as joint ventures and consolidated on the basis of the percentage share specific to each balance sheet and income statement item when they are classified as joint operations.

Companies in which the Group exercises significant influence (associates) are included the

in financial statements on an equity basis.

Significant intercompany transactions and unrealized internal profits are eliminated.

Outstanding price supplements payable to shareholders who have sold shares to the Group are recorded in the financial position, in financial liabilities (Automotive and Mobilities segments) or in other liabilities (Sales Financing segment) to give a better estimation of the obligation. The liability is initially recognized via an adjustment to goodwill (or unconsolidated investments) and subsequently via profit and loss (other financial income and expenses, or the share in net income of associates and joint ventures, depending on the nature of the investment).

2-D. Presentation ofthe consolidated financial statements

Valuation basis

The consolidated financial statements are established under the historical cost convention, except for certain categories of assets and liabilities, in compliance with IFRS rules. The categories concerned are detailed in the following notes.

Operating income and operating margin

Operating income includes all revenues and costs directly related to the Group’s activities, whether recurrent or resulting from non-recurring decisions or operations, such as restructuring costs.

The operating margin, corresponds which to the operating income of an individual segment as defined in IFRS 8, Operating Segments, corresponds to the operating income before other operating income and expenses, which are by nature unusual or significant and could

affect comparability of the margin. Other operating income and expenses cover:

● restructuring and workforce adjustment costs and significant costs relating to discontinued activities.

A restructuring is a program that is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either: a) the scope of a business undertaken by an entity; or b) the manner in which that business is conducted. The estimated cost of workforce adjustment measures, which for accounting purposes is treated as an employee benefit, is covered by a provision over the estimated residual employment period of the employees concerned. The cost of termination indemnities

is recognized as soon as a detailed plan has either been announced or is in progress. The amount recorded is net of existing provisions for pensions;

● gains or losses on partial or total disposal of businesses or operating entities, gains or losses on total or partial disposals of investments in associates and joint ventures,

other gains and losses relating to changes in the scope of consolidation such as acquisitions of control, as defined by IFRS 10, over entities previously accounted for under the equity method and direct acquisition costs for entities that are fully consolidated or consolidated on a line-by-line percentage of interest basis;

● gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets (except leased assets sales);

● impairment on property, plant and equipment or intangible assets and goodwill (excluding goodwill of associates or joint ventures);

● unusual items, i.e. income and charges that are unusual in their frequency, nature or amount, relating to significant litigation or impairment of operating receivables.

With the exception of the tax charge, the share in net income of associates and joint ventures and financial interest on pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations, all income and expenses resulting from the Sales Financing activity are included in operating income and expenses.

Equity method consolidation of associates and joint ventures

The share in net income of associates and joint ventures reported in the Group’s consolidated income statement comprises the share in these entities’ profits or losses, impairment and recoveries of impairment relating to these entities (see Note 2-M). The impairment booked is limited to the net book value of the investment, unless an additional commitment has been made.

The gain or loss resulting from the sale or loss of significant influence or joint control over associates and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method and the gain or loss on acquisition of control, as defined by IFRS 10, over companies that were already consolidated but not controlled, is reported in other operating income and expenses in the Group’s consolidated income statement. This includes transfers of accumulated translation adjustments during the period the entity was accounted for under the equity method.

The Group recognizes a deferred tax liability on dividend distributions for all differences between the book and tax values of its investments in associates and joint ventures (see Note 2-I). This tax is included in current and deferred taxes in the Group’s income statement.

Goodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the value of the relevant entities as stated in the assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. In the event of impairment, an impairment loss is booked and included in the income

consolidated statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures (see Note 2-J).

434

Acquisition expenses related to investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the initial acquisition cost for these investments.

Cross-investments between a consolidated entity and an associate are neutralized in measuring the investment in the associate as stated in the assets of the statement of financial position. Nissan’s 15% stake in Renault is therefore neutralized in valuing the investment in Nissan shown in the assets of the consolidated statement of financial position (see Note 12).

Dividends received from unlisted associates and joint ventures are included in the Automotive operational free cash flow, while dividends received from listed associates and joint ventures, i.e. Nissan, are excluded from Automotive operational free cash flow.

Reporting by operating segment

The

information by operating segment is based on internal reporting to the Board of Management, which is identified the

as “Chief Operating Decision-Maker”. All Group financial data are assigned to the operating segments. The “Intersegment transactions” column is reserved for transactions between the segments, which are carried out on near-market terms. Dividend payments by the Sales Financing segment are included in net financial

income and

expenses of

the Automotive segment.

The indicator used to evaluate segment performance is the operating margin.

The effects of the French consolidated taxation system are included in the tax expense of the Automotive segment.

Assets and liabilities are specific to each segment. Receivables assigned by the Automotive segment to the Sales Financing companies are treated as operating assets by the assignee when the risks and benefits are substantially transferred. These receivables are mostly receivables on the dealership network.

Vehicles and batteries for which the Automotive segment has a repurchase commitment are included in the segment’s assets. When these assets are financed by the Sales Financing segment, the Sales Financing segment recognizes a receivable on the Automotive segment.

Current and non-current assets and liabilities

Sales Financing receivables, other securities, derivatives, loans and financial liabilities of the Sales Financing segment (other than redeemable shares and subordinated loans) are considered as current assets and liabilities, because they are used in this operating segment’s normal business cycle.

For the Automotive segment, in addition to items directly related to the business cycle, all assets and liabilities maturing within one year are classified as current.

2-E. Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements

into the presentation currency and hyperinflation effects

05

Translation ofthe accounts of foreign companies

The Group’s presentation currency is the euro.

For foreign companies, the functional currency is generally the local currency. In cases where most transactions are carried out in a different currency, that is adopted as the functional currency.

Foreign companies’ accounts are established in their functional currency and subsequently translated into the Group’s presentation currency as follows:

●

financial position items other than components of shareholders’ equity, which are stated at historical value, are translated at the closing exchange rate; and

● income statement items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period;

● the translation

adjustment is one

of the

other components of comprehensive income and therefore has no impact on net income.

Goodwill generated by a business combination with a foreign company is treated as an asset or liability of the entity acquired, as appropriate. It is therefore expressed in the relevant entity's functional currency and translated into euros atthe closing rate.

When a foreign company is sold, the accumulated translation adjustments on its assets and liabilities are transferred to other operating income and expenses in the income statement.

Hyperinflation

To determine whether a country is in hyperinflation, the Group refers to the list published by the International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Center for Audit Quality. The financial statements of entities in hyperinflationary economies are translated in accordance with IAS 29

“Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies”. Non-monetary balance sheet items, income statement items, comprehensive income items and cash flow statement items are adjusted for inflation in their original local currency, then all the financial statements are translated at the closing exchange rate for the period. This hyperinflationary accounting leads to recognition of a gain or loss resulting from exposure to hyperinflation, which is classified as other financial

income expenses and thus included in reserves the following year.

The accounts of the Group’s subsidiaries in Argentina are consolidated in accordance with the principles of IAS 29, which have been applied since January 1, 2018. The effects of index-based restatement and translation of

the shareholders’ equity of subsidiaries in Argentina are all included in the translation adjustment in other components of comprehensive income, since restatement based on price indexes is correlated with movements in the exchange rate between the Argentinian peso and the euro and mitigates the effect ofthe peso’s devaluation.

The accounts of equity-accounted companies in Turkey are consolidated in accordance with the principles of IAS 29, applied from January 1, 2022.

2-F. Translation of foreign currency transactions

Transactions undertaken in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity concerned are initially translated to and recorded in the functional currency, using the rate applicable at the transaction date.

For financial reporting purposes, monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency

are translated at the closing rate. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognized in the income statement, except for foreign exchange gains and losses on financial instruments designated as hedges of a net investmentin a foreign entity (see Note 2-X).

The following impacts are therefore recorded in net income:

● translation adjustments related to financial operations by the Automotive segment are included in the net financial income;

● other translation adjustments are included in the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment).

Derivatives are measured and recorded as described in Note 2-X.

2-G. Revenues and margin

Revenues comprise all proceeds from sales of the Group’s automotive goods, services related to these sales and the various Sales Financing products marketed by the Group’s companies to their customers.

Sales of goods and services and associated costs ofthe Automotive segment

Sales and margin recognition Sales of automotive goods are recognized at the date control

is transferred. The transfer of control over automotive goods takes place when the goods are made available to the distribution network in the case of non- Group dealers (at the time they are added to or removed from stock, depending on the contractual arrangements) or upon delivery to the end-userin the case of direct sales.

However, there is no transfer of control in the case of goods sold under an operating lease by a Group finance company, or in the case of goods sold with a buy-back commitment if it is highly likely that they will be returned. In

such transactions, the revenues are recognized progressively over the lease period and a used vehicle sale is recorded when control of the used vehicle is transferred. The difference between the price paid by the customer and the buy-back price is treated as rental income and spread over the period the automotive item is at the customer’s disposal. The production cost for the new automotive item concerned is recorded in inventories for contracts of less than one year, or included in property, plant and equipment under fixed assets leased to customers when the contracts exceed one year. The forecast resale value takes account of recent known developments on the second-hand automotive market but also future anticipated developments over the period in which the automotive goods will be sold, which may be influenced by factors both external (economic situation, taxation) and internal (changes in the range or the manufacturer’s pricing strategy). As soon as a loss is expected on the resale, a provision (if the automotive item is in inventories) or additional depreciation (if the automotive item is

included in property, plant and equipment) is recognized to cover the loss.

Sales incentive programs

Sales incentive programs based on the volumes or prices of products sold are deducted from sales when the sales operations concerned are recorded. Any provisions are based on estimates of the most probable amount.

The Group undertakes certain promotional campaigns offering reduced-interest customer credit or discounts on services. Because these are sales incentives, the cost of these operations is recognized as a reduction in sales by the Automotive segment when the vehicle sale takes place and is not spread over the duration of the financing orthe services concerned.

Warranty The Group makes a distinction between insurance-type warranties and service-type warranties. Provisions are

436

established for insurance-type warranties, while service- type warranties give rise to revenue that is spread over the duration of the warranty extension.

The estimated

or incurred

costs relating manufacturer’s product or part warranties classified as insurance-type warranties are charged to expenses when the sales are recorded. Provisions for costs still to be borne are valued on the basis of observed data for each model and engine regarding the level of costs and their distribution

to

over

the

covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. In the event of product recalls following incidents that come to light after the vehicle has been put on the market, provisions are established to cover the costs involved as soon as the decision to undertake the recall campaign has been made. Amounts claimed from suppliers are deducted from the warranty expense when it is considered practically certain they will be recovered.

periods

Services related to sales of automotive products

Revenues from service contracts sold by the Group are recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. These contracts may be for warranty extensions, maintenance or insurance.

Such service contracts may be sold separately to the final customer or included free of charge in a sale package covering a vehicle and related services. In either case, the Group considers service contracts as a separate service obligation from delivery of the vehicle and allocates a portion of revenue to the service contract.

When the customer makes regular payments for the service contract, the revenue is recognized on a straight- line basis. When the contract is prepaid (for example, when it is paid for by the customer at the time of the vehicle purchase), the amounts received are recorded as deferred income and spread over the duration of the contract, on a straight-line basis for warranty extensions and following an experience curve for maintenance contracts.

Impairment of customer receivables

Impairment is booked in respect of the Automotive segment’s customer receivables to

reflect the prospective assessment of the credit risk at the inception of the receivable and any deterioration of that risk over time. When there is an incurred credit loss, impairment is recorded individually for each receivable.

Sales Financing revenues

Sales Financing revenues

Sales Financing revenues are generated by financing operations for sales of vehicles to dealers and end-users. These financing operations take the form of loans from the Sales Financing segment companies and are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost under the effective interest

rate method, less any impairment. Income on these contracts is calculated so as to give a constant interest rate over the period and is included in sales revenues.

Sustainable development

Corporate governance

Financial statements

Sales Financing costs Sales financing costs are considered as operating expenses and

included in the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment). They mainly comprise interest incurred by sales financing companies to refinance their customer loan transactions, other costs and revenues directly related to administration of this type of refinancing (temporary investments, hedging and management of exchange and interest rate risks) and the cost of risks related to receivables. Refinancing comes from diversified sources: public and private bond issues, public and private

securitization backed by Automotive segment loans, negotiable debt instruments, savings collected and financing from credit institutions and assimilate or the European Central Bank.

Commissions payable to business intermediaries

Commissions are treated as external distribution costs and therefore deferred as contract acquisition costs, so as to give a constant interest rate over the term of the financing contracts.

Classification and impairment of receivables

The impairment method receivables depends on the

for

financial

category concerned.

For healthy receivables (stage 1), impairment is equivalent to the 12-month expected credit loss; for receivables on which the credit risk has significantly deteriorated since initial recognition or which received extensions during the lockdown (stage 2), impairment is equivalent to the lifetime expected losses; and for receivables in default (stage 3), impairment is equivalent to the incurred credit loss.

The Sales Financing segment uses an internal scoring system or external ratings to identify any significant deterioration in the credit risk. In addition, this segment has decided to use the assumptions set out in the standard and downgrades

thus any receivable outstanding after 30 days to stage 2 and any receivable

2-H. Financial income (expenses)

The cost of net financial indebtedness comprises the cost of gross financial indebtedness less income associated with cash, cash equivalents and financial assets of the Automotive The cost of

segment. financial indebtedness consists of income expenses generated by the Automotive

gross and financial segment’s indebtedness during the period, including the impact of the effective portion of the related interest rate hedges.

2-I. Income tax

The Group recognizes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the tax and book values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Deferred taxes are calculated at the latest tax rate enacted at the closing date applicable to the period when temporary differences are reversed. Each individual fiscal entity (legal entity, establishment or group of entities that pays tax to the tax administration) that is

still outstanding after 90 days to stage 3. Receivables in default (stage 3) are identified by the Sales Financing segment in compliance with the European Banking Authority’s EBA/GL/2016/07 guidelines. The Sales

05

Financing segment has opted for the “one step” approach, which consists of applying the new definition of default and adjusting its internal models concurrently for the Dealer portfolio and Customer portfolio.

The Sales Financing segment refers to the current recommendations of the Basel Committee to generate the parameters needed to calculate the probability of default and the loss rates in the event of default on loans and financing, finance lease receivables, irrevocable financing commitments and financial guarantees given to customers and dealers in its principal countries of business (Germany, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom for customer and dealer financing, Korea for customer financing only). For other assets, a standard approach based on a simplified methodology is applied. As

the assumptions used are essentially based on observable market data, the calculation of impairment for expected credit losses in the Sales Financing segment also incorporates forward-looking macro-economic data (GDP, long-term rates, etc) to reflect changes in indicators and sector-specific information.

Write-off rules

The gross book value of a financial asset is written off when there are no reasonable expectations of recovery. The asset is derecognized via a loss account and the associated impairment is reversed when the non- recoverability of receivables is confirmed, or at the latest when the Sales Financing segment’s rights as creditor are extinguished. Examples of receivables that become non-

recoverable and are derecognized

are waivers negotiated with customers (notably as part of a recovery plan), time-barred receivables, receivables concerned by an unfavorable legal judgement (when the outcome of a lawsuit or litigation is negative) and receivables owed by a customer that no longer exists

Other financial income and expenses mainly include foreign exchange gains and losses on financial items and related hedges, the gain or loss caused by exposure to hyperinflation (see Note 2-E), the net interest on provisions for pensions and dividends and impairment of companies that are neither controlled nor under significant influence by the Group.

authorized to offset its current tax assets and liabilities reports deferred tax assets and liabilities net. Recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the probability of future recovery.

For associates and joint ventures, a deferred tax liability on dividend distributions is booked

for differences between the book value and tax value of shares held.

Renault Group

Financial statements

Tax credits that can only be used against a taxable profit are recorded as a deduction from the income tax payable. Tax credits that are recoverable regardless of whether the company makes a taxable profit are set against the relevant nature of expense.

2-J. Goodwill

Non-controlling interests (commonly called “minority interests”) are carried at fair value (the full goodwill method) or at their share in the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities transferred (the partial goodwill method). To date Renault has only recognized goodwill valued under the partial goodwill method. The choice of which method to use is made for each individual case.

Impairment tests of goodwill are carried out at least annually or whenever there is evidence of loss of value. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment.

To determine the provisions for uncertain tax liabilities, the Group uses a case-by-case method based on the most probable value. In view of their qualitative characteristics these provisions are reported on specific lines in the consolidated financial position.

Goodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the value of the entities concerned as reported in the assets in the statement of financial position. In the event of impairment, an impairment loss is booked and included in the consolidated income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures. Acquisitions of additional investments concerning non- controlling interests in companies controlled by the Group are treated as equity transactions. The positive or negative difference between the cost of acquiring shares the

and book value of the non-controlling interests acquired is recorded in shareholders’ equity.

2-K. Research and development expenses and other intangible assets

Research and development expenses

Development expenses incurred between the decision to begin development and implement production facilities for a new vehicle or component (e.g. engine or gearbox) and the subsequent approval of the design for mass production are capitalized as intangible assets. They are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date of approval for production, over the expected market life of the vehicle or part, which is initially no longer than seven are regularly reviewed and

years. Market lives

subsequently adjusted if there is a significant difference

from

the initial estimate. Capitalized development expenses mainly comprise the cost of prototypes, the cost of studies invoiced by external firms, the cost of personnel assigned to the project and a share of overheads dedicated exclusively to development activities.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the development of a project requiring at least 12 months of preparation before commissioning are included in the gross value of the asset, which is a “qualifying asset”. The capitalization rate for borrowing costs is limited such that capitalized borrowing costs do not exceed the total borrowing costs borne during the year. When a project is financed through

438

a specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.

Expenses incurred before the decision to begin product development are recorded as costs in the period they are incurred, in the same way as research expenses. Expenses incurred after the start of mass production are treated as production costs.

Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets comprise patents, leasehold rights, intangible business assets, licences, software, brands and similar rights purchased by the Group. When they have a finite useful life, patents, leasehold rights, licences, brands and

similar rights purchased are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of protection stipulated by the contact or the law, or over the useful

life if shorter. Intangible business assets and softwares are amortized over their useful life. The useful life of intangible assets is generally between 3 and 5 years. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, are subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and when there is any indication of impairment.

2-L. Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets

The gross value of property, plant and equipment corresponds to historical acquisition or production cost.

expenses paid and cash flows from financing activities are impacted by the reimbursed lease liability.

05

Design and preparation expenses are included in the asset’s production cost.

The production cost for property, plant and equipment also includes financing costs borne during the construction phase, under the same method as for intangible assets. When a project is financed through a specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interestrate on the borrowing.

Investment subsidies received

are, where relevant, presented as a deduction from the gross value of the assets concerned.

Subsequent expenses for property, plant and equipment, except those incurred to increase productivity or prolong the life of an asset, are charged to expenses as incurred. Assets leased to customers include vehicles leased for more than one year from a Group finance company with a buy-back commitment by the Group and vehicles sold under an agreement including a clause for buy-back after a minimum one year of use. Assets leased to customers also include vehicles covered by operating leases longer than one year from Group finance companies and batteries leased to electric vehicle users by Group finance companies (see Note 2-G).

Right-of-use assets

The Group’s leases are essentially forreal estate property.

A contract contains a lease if it gives the lessee the right to use an identified asset for a specified period of time in exchange for payment.

At

the contract’s

commencement

date,

a lessee recognizes an asset related to the right of use and a financial liability that represents the lease obligation. The right-of-use asset is amortized over the estimated term of the lease. The lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of lease payments over the expected term of the lease. The discount is unwound using the implicit interest rate of the lease agreement if it can be readily determined, or at the incremental borrowing rate otherwise. The incremental borrowing rate, calculated for each monetary zone, corresponds to the risk-free rate applicable in the zone plus the Group’s risk premium applicable for the local currency. In the income statement, amortization of the right-of-use asset is recorded in the operating income (operating margin in the information by segment)

operating and a financial expense corresponding to the interest on the lease liability is recorded in financial income and expenses. The tax impact of this consolidation adjustment is recognized via deferred taxes. In the cash flow statement, cash flows operating activities are impacted by interest

from

Subsequently, the right-of-use asset is regularly reduced by impairment where relevant (if impairment tests are conducted under the principles presented in Note 2-N) and adjusted on the basis of certain corresponding restatements of the lease obligation.

Lease payments on short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets are treated as operating expenses.

The term of the lease is the non-cancellable period of a lease contract during which the lessee has the right to use the leased asset, extended by any renewal options the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. For French commercial leases, the lease term is generally 9 years. Lease term estimation and consideration of extension and termination options is conducted with the help of the real estate department, considering the types of site and their development plans.

When a lease is renegotiated to shorten the term or reduce the space leased, the Group recognizes the reassessment of the lease obligation and the gain or loss resulting from the partial termination is recognized in the operating income (other operating income and expenses). When the Group revises the exercise value of a purchase, extension or termination option (for example by applying early termination clauses), a corresponding adjustment is made to the book value of the right-of-use asset.

Improvements to leased buildings are depreciated over a duration that is equal to or shorter than the lease term used to estimate the lease liability (if the lessee has neither the intention nor the ability to use them for a longer period).

When a lease contract contains a purchase option the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, it is in substance a purchase rather than a lease. The corresponding liability is considered as a financial liability under IFRS 9 and the asset as a tangible asset in compliance with IAS 16.

Provisions for repairs required contractually by lessors are recognized at the start of the lease, with a corresponding tangible asset.

Sale and leaseback operations

In application of IFRS 16, for a sale and leaseback operation, reference is made to the requirements of IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of the asset should be treated as a sale or a financing operation.

If the transfer of an asset does not qualify under IFRS 15 for recognition as a sale, the asset transferred remains in the assets reported in the statement of financial position and a financial liability equal to the proceeds of the transfer is recognized.

Financial statements

If the transfer of an asset is recognized as a sale and the Group then leases back part or all of the asset sold, only the amount of the gain or loss on the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor is recognized and the right-of-use asset is adjusted in proportion to the interest retained in the net book value of the asset transferred.

Depreciation

In the Automotive and Sales Financing segments, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

2-M. Impairment

Impairment offixed assets

Fixed assets are subjected to impairment tests as soon as there is any indication of a loss of value, such as significant adverse changes in the market in which the company operates, or changes the

affecting circumstances and manner of use of the assets.

For the Automotive segment, impairment tests are carried out attwo levels:

At the level of vehicle-specific assets (including

components)

Vehicle-specific assets (including components) consist of capitalized development expenses and tools. Impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value of the assets with the recoverable value, calculated based on discounted future cash flows related to the vehicle and its components. These assets may be specific to the model and/or the country of destination.

Atthe level of cash-generating units A cash-generating unit is defined as a coherent subset that generates largely independent cash flows. Cash- generating units may represent an economic entity (plant or subsidiary) or the whole Automotive segment. Net fixed assets related to cash-generating units notably include goodwill, specific assets and capacity assets and components of working capital.

For each of the two levels, impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value with the recoverable value. Recoverable value is defined as the higher of value in use orfair value less selling costs.

Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the use of an asset. Future cash flows derive from the business plan drawn up and validated by the Management, plus a terminal value on discounted normative after based cash

flows application of a growth rate to infinity. They also include a

bonus (“excess earnings”) paid to the Automotive segment for business referrals to the Sales Financing segment. The assumptions underlying the business plan include estimates of market developments in countries in which the Group operates and its share of those markets,

changes in the sale price of products and the prices of purchased components and commodities. The pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital as determined by the company.

When the recoverable value is lower than the net book value, impairment equivalent to the difference is recorded against the assets concerned.

For the Sales Financing segment, an impairment test is carried out at least once a year or whenever there is an indication of loss of value, by comparing the book value and recoverable value of assets. Recoverable value is defined as the higher of fair value (less selling costs) and value in use. The value in use is based on a market approach, determined by using multiples for each group of cash-generating units made up of legal entities or groups of legal entities in the same country.

Impairment ofinvestments in associates and joint ventures

Impairment tests of the value of investments in associates and joint ventures are carried out as soon as there is any indication of a

loss of value, essentially significant adverse changes in the markets in which the company operates, or a major or long-term decline in stock market value.

Impairment tests are carried out in compliance with IAS 28 and IAS 36, by comparing the book value of the investment in the associate or joint venture with the recoverable value, which is the higher of value in use and fair value, less selling costs. The value in use is equal to the share of the present value of future estimated cash flows expected by the associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture is listed, the fair value is its stock market value.

When the recoverable value is lower than the book value, impairment equivalent to the difference is recorded against the relevant investment in an associate or joint venture and included in the Group’s income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.

2-N. Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations

05

Assets and liabilities held for sale are non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities that are available for immediate sale and are highly likely to be sold within twelve months due to advanced discussions with a known buyer.

Assets and groups of assets and liabilities held for sale are presented separately in the statement of consolidated financial position, in accordance with IFRS 5. They are stated at the lower of net book value and fair value less selling costs. No further depreciation or amortization is recorded on non-current assets that are classified as held

2-O. Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost corresponds to acquisition cost or production cost, which includes direct and indirect production expenses and a share of manufacturing overheads, based on a forecast level of activity and the results of any related hedges. The level of activity is forecast site by site, in order to determine the share of fixed costs to be excluded ifthe actual level of activity is lower.

for sale (or included in a group of assets and liabilities held for sale).

Discontinued operations, as defined by IFRS 5 – Non- current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, are activities or geographical zones that are significant to the Group and are in the process of being sold or are classified as assets held for sale. The income statement and cash flow statement items relating to discontinued operations are presented on specific lines in the consolidated financial statements for all the periods presented.

Inventories of the Automotive segment and the Sales Financing segment are valued under the FIFO (First In First Out) method.

When the net realizable value is lower than the financial position value, impairment equal to the difference is recorded.

2-P. Assignment of receivables and reverse factoring

Receivables assigned to third parties (through securitization, discounting, or factoring) are removed from Group assets

when the associated risks and benefits are also substantially transferred to the third parties in question. Risk analysis principally concerns the credit risk, the risk of late payment and the country risk. The same rule applies in the Automotive segment and the Sales Financing segment.

The Automotive segment sometimes uses reverse-factoring programs. These programs can be used to support a supplier, or to benefit the Group by extending payment deadlines. In the first case, the liability continues to be considered as part of the operating cycle and the amounts concerned remain in trade payables in the financial position.

2-Q. Treasury shares

Treasury shares are shares held for the purposes of stock option plans, performance share plans, other share-based payment arrangements and the liquidity contract.

In the second case, if the reverse factoring contract includes an unconditional commitment by the Group to pay the amount initially due to the supplier to the financial institution that is a party to the contract, the liability is no longer considered as part of the operating cycle and the amounts concerned are reclassified as financial liabilities (this has no impact on the cash flow statement at the reclassification date). If the contract is considered as a financial liability and covers a financing requirement for the group subsidiary involved, the repayments to financial institutions impact cash flows from financing activities in the cash flow statement; otherwise, they are included in cash flows from operating activities.

They are recorded at acquisition cost and deducted from Group shareholders’ equity until the date of sale.

When these shares are sold, the sale price is directly included in consolidated shareholders’

equity.

Consequently, no gain or loss on treasury shares is included in the net income for the period.

2-R. Performance share plans attribution plans and other share-based

payment agreements

The Group awards performance shares and other share- based payments made in Renault shares. The grant date is the date at which beneficiaries are informed of the decision to award shares and the terms of the share plan. For plans subject to performance conditions, an estimate of achievement of the conditions is taken into account in determining the number of shares distributed. This estimate is reviewed annually based on changes in the probability of performance condition achievement. The final fair value of services rendered in for return performance shares is measured by reference to the fair value of those shares at their grant date. Entitlements to performance shares are valued based on the share value

at the grant date less dividends expected during the vesting period. The share price volatility factor applied is implicit volatility at the grant date. The expected dividend is determined

by reference to the dividend payout schedule announced at the time each plan is valued.

The total fair value calculated in this way is spread on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period. This

2-S. Pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations

The Group’s payments for defined-contribution benefit plans are recorded as expenses for the relevant period. For defined-benefit

plans concerning post-employment benefits, the Group uses the Projected Unit Credit Method to determine the present value of its obligations. Under this method, benefits are attributed to periods of service according to the plan's benefit formula, principally on a straight-line basis overtheyears ofservice that earn benefit entitlements.

The future payments for employee benefits are measured on the basis of future salary increases, retirement age, mortality and length of employment with the company and are discounted at a rate determined by reference to yields on long-term high quality corporate bonds of a

2-T. Workforce adjustment measures

duration corresponding to the estimated average duration of the benefit plan concerned.

The actuarial gains and losses resulting from revisions of the underlying assumptions and experience-based adjustments are included in other components

of comprehensive income.

The net expense for the year, corresponding to the current period service cost plus the past service cost where relevant, is charged to the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment). The interest expense on the net defined-benefit liability (asset) is recorded in the net financial income and expenses.

The cost of termination indemnities is recognized as soon as a detailed plan has either been announced or is in progress. The amount recorded is net

of existing provisions for pensions.

2-U. Financial assets and receivables of the Sales Financing segment

The Group recognizes a financial asset when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial

instrument.

Financial assets comprise investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not exercise significant influence,

marketable securities, negotiable debt instruments, loans and derivative assets related to financialtransactions (see Note 2-X).

These instruments are presented as non-current assets, apart from those maturing within 12 months of the closing date, which are classified as current assets.

Investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not have significant influence

Investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not have significant influence are classified as equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss. The fair values of such financial assets are determined in priority by reference to the market price. If this is not possible, the Group uses a valuation method that is not based on market data.

2-V. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash includes cash on hand, current accounts and other demand deposits, with the exception of bank overdrafts, which are included in financial liabilities.

Cash equivalents are investments held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash For an

commitments. investment to qualify as a cash equivalent, it must be considered as liquid, be readily convertible for a known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

05

Marketable securities and negotiable debt instruments

Short-term investments in

the

form

of marketable securities and negotiable debt

instruments are undertaken for the management of cash surpluses, but do not meet the requirements to qualify as cash equivalents. These are debt instruments carried at fair value through other components of comprehensive income, except for shares in investment funds (UCITS) which are carried at fair value through profit and loss.

Impairment equivalent to expected credit losses is booked upon initial recognition of debt instruments carried at

fair value through other components of comprehensive income.

Loans

Loans essentially include loans for investment of cash surpluses and loans to associates.

Loans are carried at amortized cost. Impairment equivalent to expected credit losses is recognized upon initial recognition of the financial asset and when there is objective evidence of loss of value caused by an event arising after the initial recognition.

These instruments are stated at amortized cost except for shares in investment funds (UCITS) which are carried at fair value through profit and loss.

Bank accounts subject to restrictions due to sector- specific regulations (for example, banking or insurance regulations) or bank accounts allocated to increasing credit on securitized receivables are included in cash and cash equivalents.

2-W. Financial liabilities of the Automotive segment and Sales Financing debts

The Group recognizes a financial liability (for the Automotive segment) or a Sales Financing debt when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument.

Financial liabilities and Sales Financing debts comprise redeemable shares, subordinated debt, bonds, other debts represented by a certificate, borrowings from credit institutions, lease liabilities (see Note 2-L), other interest- bearing borrowings and derivative liabilities related to financialtransactions (see Note 2-X).

Redeemable shares of the Automotive segment are listed subordinated debt instruments that earn a variable return indexed on consolidated revenues. They are carried at amortized cost, determined by discounting forecast

coupons using the effective interest rate on borrowings. The estimated effective interest rate takes account of indexation and the amortized cost recorded in financial result is re-estimated when there is a significant change in future sales prospects, particularly when medium-term business plans are released.

Financial liabilities not concerned by specific hedge accounting methods (see Note 2-X) are generally recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. financial expense calculated in this way includes issuance expenses and issuance or redemption premiums, together with the impact of debt renegotiations when the old and new terms are not substantially different.

2-X. Derivatives and hedge accounting

Measurement and presentation

Derivatives are initially stated at fair value. This fair value is subsequently reviewed at each closing date.

● The fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency swaps is determined by discounting future cash flows, using closing-date market rates (exchange and interest rates).

● The fair value of interest rate derivatives is the amount the Group would receive (or pay) to settle outstanding contracts at the closing date, taking into account interest rates forward curves and the quality of the counterparty to each contract at the closing date. This fair value includes accrued interest.

● The fair value of commodity derivatives is based on market conditions.

The Automotive segment’s derivatives are reported in the

financial position as current if they mature within 12 months and non-current otherwise. All Sales Financing segment derivatives are reported in the financial position as current.

Hedge accounting

The treatment of derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the type of hedging relationship:

● fair value hedge;

● cash flow hedge;

● hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.

The Group identifies the hedging instrument and the hedged item as soon as the hedge is set up and documents the hedging relationship, stating the hedging strategy, the risk hedged and the method used to assess the hedge’s effectiveness. The Sales Financing segment documents hedging relationships concerning one or more homogeneous items to cover its This

risks. documentation is subsequently updated such that the

effectiveness of the designated

hedge can

be

demonstrated.

444 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

Hedge accounting uses specific measurement and recognition methods for each category of hedge.

● Fair value hedges: the hedged item is adjusted to fair value up to the risk hedged and the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. As changes in these items are recorded in the income statement simultaneously, only the ineffective portion of the hedge has an impact on net income. It is recorded in the same income statement item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.

● Cash flow hedges: no adjustment is made to the value of the hedged item; only the hedging instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment, the effective portion of the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk is net

in other components comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is included in net income. The cumulative amount included in shareholders’ equity is transferred to the income statement when the hedged item has an impact on net income.

of recorded, of taxes,

● Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: the hedging instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment, the effective portion of the change in fair value attributable to the hedged exchange risk is net other of

recorded, of

taxes, in components comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is included in net income. The cumulative amount included in shareholders’ equity is transferred to net income at the date of liquidation or sale of the investment. The interest rate component of borrowings in yen used to hedge the investment in Nissan is considered as the ineffective portion and is therefore recorded directly in financial income and expenses.

Derivatives not designated as hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized directly in financial income, except in the case of derivatives entered into exclusively for reasons closely related to business operations. In this case, changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment).

3-A. Changes in the scope of consolidation

Automotive

● Starting from the first half-year of 2022, the Group fully consolidates the Turkish-based company Renault Group Otomotiv A.S., which was set up at the end of 2021 for new industrial and commercial projects and is fully- owned by Renault.

● In March 2022 the Group acquired a 13.7% stake in BeyonCa HK Limited, a company in which it exercises significant influence, for the price of €18 million followed by a €29 million capital increase. This company is accounted for under the equity method.

● On 15 May 2022 the Group sold its subsidiary Renault Russia to the city of Moscow and its 67.69% investment in Avtovaz to

NAMI (the Central Research and Development Automobile and Engine Institute), each for the sale price of one rouble. The sale agreement gives Renault Group an option to buy back its investment, which can be exercised during certain periods over the next six years. The contribution made by these entities is presented under discontinued operations, in

accordance with IFRS 5. The accounting effects are described in Note 3-B below.

● In May 2022, the Group sold the distribution company Renault Nordic AB, which operates in the Swedish and Danish markets, for the price of €37 million of which €14 million will be paid over the next five years.

●

In September 2022, the Group sold the distribution companies Renault Nissan Slovenija and Renault Nissan Croatia, for the price of €9 million and €7 million respectively.

3-B. Discontinued operations

On March 23, 2022, Renault Group announced the suspension of Renault Russia’s activities and said it was assessing the available options for its investment in Avtovaz. The Group stated that impairment of its tangible and intangible assets and goodwill in Russia, estimated at €2,195 million at December 31, 2022, would be recognized during the first half-year of 2022. A press release of 12 May 2022 confirmed that this impairment had been booked at March 31, 2022. It was then announced on May 16, 2022 that agreements had been signed to sell 100% of the shares in Renault Russia to the city of Moscow and the 67.69% stake in Lada Auto Holding (the parent company of Avtovaz) to NAMI (the Central Research and Development Automobile

● In October 2022, the Group sold the distribution company Renault Hungaria Kft which operates on the Hungarian market, for the sale price of €16 million, €3 million of which will be paid in instalments over the next five years.

● In November 2022, the Group sold its entire investment in its French subsidiary Fonderie de Bretagne to the German group Callista GmbH. Under the terms of the sale, which took place for the symbolic price of €1, Renault Group gave a commitment to provide €57 million funding for a secure recovery plan.

● In November 2022, RKM, a Korean subsidiary owned 80% by the Group, undertook a 34% capital increase for the Geely Group in exchange for

the simultaneous acquisition of a technological licence from Geely for the same amount, i.e. 264 billion won (approximately €194 million). Renault Group’s percentage interest in RKM was 53% at December 31, 2022.

Sales Financing

● The Group finalized determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities transferred from BI-PI Mobility SL and its subsidiaries, of which it purchased 100% in July 2021 for the price of €67 million. This company specializes in flexible vehicle rentals. The principal adjustments concern the brand, recognized at the value of €8 million and the technology, recognized at the value of €5 million. The final goodwill is calculated at €59 million. BI-PI Mobility SL also formed two new subsidiaries in the UK and the Netherlands in 2022, BI-PI Mobility UK Ltd and BI-PI Mobility Netherlands, both fully-owned and fully-consolidated.

and Engine Institute). This led to deconsolidation of Renault Russia and the Avtovaz Group during the first half-year of 2022.

The table below provides details of the income statement for these discontinued operations from January 1 to April 30, 2022, together with the gain on the sale of the shares in Renault Russia and Lada Auto Holding and the effects of the sale (debt waiver, impairment of dedicated inventories, repayment of some of the financial debt of Renault Russia, etc).

In application of IFRS 5, the cash flow items of Renault Russia, Avtovaz and its subsidiaries, sales by Group companies to the Russian entities and impairment of assets located outside the Russian Federation that lost value as a direct result of the Group’s exit from the Russian

Federation, have also been classified as discontinued operations. The statement of consolidated and of the statement comprehensive net income

consolidated cash flows for 2021, have been adjusted accordingly.

3-C. Non-current assets (liabilities) held for sale

At the Capital Market Day on November 8, 2022, Renault Group announced the signature of

a framework agreement with the Geely Group for creation of a new worldwide entity to develop, manufacture and supply low- emission hybrid engines and powertrains. The framework agreement stipulates that Renault Group and Geely will each hold 50% of the shares in this new venture. The assets and liabilities held for sale, collectively referred to as Horse below, will be deconsolidated in the second half- year of 2023.

In application of its strategic plan “Renaulution”, the Group has started to sell certain real estate assets (land, industrial sites), branches (in France) and vehicle

distribution subsidiaries (outside France).

(€ million) Intangible assets and goodwill Tangible assets Inventories 21

At December 31, 2022, the group of assets held for sale consists of €3,861 million of assets and €(873) million of debts and other liabilities. The variation in these amounts between December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, i.e. a €3,732 million increase in assets held for sale and a €(691) million increase in the associated liabilities, is mainly explained by the reclassification of “Horse” project assets and liabilities in preparation for the new joint venture dedicated to hybrid and thermal powertrains (see Note 2-B).

In 2022, €(500) million of the current income tax charge comes from foreign entities (€(345) million in 2021). This charge increased in 2022, due to the better taxable income achieved in a more favorable economic context.

The current income tax charge for entities included in the French tax consolidation group amount to €(61) million in 2022 (€(92) million in 2021).

Deferred taxes saw a positive change, generating income of €28 million. This substantial improvement in 2022 was notably driven by reversal of deferred tax liabilities outside France.

The deferred tax charge for 2021 mainly reflected the utilization of tax credits in Turkey.

The residual unrecognized deferred tax assets of entities included in the French tax consolidation group amounted to €3,909 million (€3,741 million at December 31, 2021). They comprise tax losses that can carried

be forward indefinitely to set against future taxable income up to a limit of 50% of that income. €209 million of these unrecognized assets were generated by items booked through shareholders’ equity (effects of the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan) and €3,700 million were generated by items affecting the income statement

(respectively €321 million

and €3,420

million at

December 31, 2021). In 2022, the French tax consolidation group’s tax loss carryforwards increased, particularly due to the short-term loss of €1.3 billion on the sale of the shares in Lada Auto Holding in May 2022 for the price of one rouble (Note 3-B), partly offset by a short-term tax gain of €0.6 billion on the transfer of certain assets.

For entities not in the French tax consolidation group, unrecognized deferred tax assets totalled €653 million at December 31, 2022 (€873 million at December 31, 2021) principally comprising tax loss carryforwards generated by the Group in Brazil and India.

8-E. Global Minimum Corporate Tax

On December 15, 2022, the EU member states formally adopted the directive for EU-level implementation of the minimum taxation component, known as Pillar 2, of the OECD’s international taxation reform. This directive has yet to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Thereafter, member states shall transpose the directive into their domestic law.

This directive aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% by introducing an additional

The Group carried out impairment tests on its fixed assets under the approach described in the section on accounting policies (Note 2-M).

11-A. Impairment tests on vehicle-specific assets (including components) and the assets of certain entities

Following impairment tests of specific assets dedicated to vehicles (including components) and assets belonging to certain entities, impairment of €(246) million was booked during 2022 (€(78) million in 2021), comprising €(41) million for intangible assets (€(48) million in 2021) and

€(205)

million for (€(30) million in 2021).

property,

plant and equipment

A further €(71) million of impairment was also recognized in 2021, notably after decisions to discontinue production or terminate leases.

11-B. Impairment test of the Automotive segment cash-generating unit

The recoverable value used for the purpose of impairment tests for the Automotive segment is the value in use,

Growth rate to infinity

After-tax discountrate

The assumptions at December 31, 2022 are derived from the medium-term plan for the period 2021-2025, which was presented in January 2021 and updated in late 2022. They incorporate assumptions concerning the negative effects of the electronic components supply crisis, inflation and

used for

impairment testing

increasing climate risks.

The growth rates to infinity used in the tests at December 31, 2022 and 2021 include the impacts of commitments made by the States that are signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change.

determined under

At December 31, 2022, no impairment was recognized on assets of the Automotive segment as a result of the impairment test and it was considered that a reasonably possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in a recoverable value lower than the book value of the assets tested.

The recoverable value of the assets tested would remain higher than the book value in the event of the following changes in those assumptions:

● a growth rate to infinity of 0%;

● an after-tax discount rate of 12.5%.

Share in netincome (loss) of associates accounted for by the equity method Consolidated financial position

Investments in associates accounted for by the equity method

12-A. Nissan consolidation method

Renault Group and the Japanese automakers Nissan and Mitsubishi have developed an alliance between their three distinct companies with common interests, uniting forces to achieve

optimum performance. The Alliance is organized so as to preserve individual brand identities and respect each company’s corporate culture.

Consequently:

● Renault Group is not assured of holding the majority of voting rights in Nissan’s Shareholders’ Meeting.

● The terms of the Renault Group-Nissan agreements do not entitle Renault Group to appoint the majority of Nissan directors, nor to hold the majority of voting rights at meetings of Nissan’s Board of Directors; Renault Group cannot unilaterally appoint the President of Nissan.

● In March 2019, Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced the creation of the new Alliance Operating Board (AOB) which oversees Alliance operations and governance. The Alliance Operating Board consists of

526

380

17,487 16,234

the Chairman of the Board of Renault Group, the Chief Executive Officer of Renault Group, the Chief Executive Officer of Nissan and the Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors. Orientations are taken by consensus.

In November 2019, the AOB appointed an Alliance Secretary General, who reports to the AOB and the CEOs of the three alliance companies.

● At December 31, 2022, Renault Group occupied two seats on Nissan’s Board of Directors and was represented by Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Renault Group Board and Pierre Fleuriot, Lead Director in Renault Group.

● Renault Group can neither use nor influence the use of Nissan’s assets in the same way as its own assets.

● Renault Group provides no guarantees in respect of Nissan’s debt.

In view of this situation, Renault Group is considered to exercise significant influence over Nissan and therefore uses the equity method to include its investment in Nissan in the consolidation.

12-B. Nissan consolidated financial statements included under the equity method in the Renault Group consolidation

The Nissan accounts included under the equity method in Renault Group’s financial

statements are Nissan’s consolidated accounts

published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards (as Nissan is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange), after adjustments for the requirements ofthe Renault Group consolidation.

Nissan publishes consolidated financial

statements quarterly and annually at March 31. For the purposes of the Renault Group consolidation, Nissan results are included

in line with the Renault Group calendar (the results for the period January to December are consolidated in Renault Group’s annual financial statements).

Nissan held 0.6% of its own treasury shares at December 31, 2022 (0.6% at December 31, 2021). Consequently, Renault SA’s percentage interest in Nissan is 43.7% (43.7% at December 31, 2021). Renault SA holds 43.7% of voting rights in Nissan at September 30, 2022 (43.7% at September 30, 2021).

12-G. Hedging of the investment in Nissan

05

The Group has partially hedged the yen/euro exchange risk on its investment in Nissan since 1999. Details of this hedge are given in Note 25-B2.

At December 31, 2022,

the

corresponding hedging

operations totalled ¥199.9 billion (€1,421 million) of private

placements in bonds issued directly in yen on the Japanese Samurai bond market.

In 2022 foreign exchange differences generated an unfavorable effect of €25 million (favorable effect of €4 million in 2021).

12-H. Valuation of Renault Group’s investment in Nissan at stock market prices

Based on the quoted price at December 31, 2022 of ¥418 per share, Renault Group’s investment in Nissan is valued

at €5,444 million (€7,812 million at December 31, 2021 based on the price of ¥556 per share).

12-I. Impairment test of the investment in Nissan

At December 31, 2022, the stock market value of the investment was 68.9% lower than the value of Nissan in Renault Group’s statement of financial position (51.9% at December 31, 2021).

In application of the approach presented in the note on accounting policies, an impairment test was carried out at December 31, 2022. An after-tax discount rate of 7.73% and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.42% were used to calculate value in use. The terminal value was calculated under profitability assumptions consistent with Nissan’s past data and conservative medium and

long-term prospects,

incorporating new medium-term forecasts for volumes and exchange rates.

The test result did not lead to recognition of any impairment on the investment in Nissan at December 31, 2022, and it is considered that a reasonably possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in

a recoverable value lower than the book value of the investment in Nissan.

The same conclusion was reached

following

the impairment test performed at December 31, 2021, applying an after-tax discount rate of 6.53% and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.47%.

12-J. Operations between Renault Group and the Nissan Group

Renault Group and Nissan follow joint strategies for vehicle and component

development, purchasing, production and distribution resources. This cooperation is reflected in synergies that reduce costs.

The Automotive segment is involved in operations with Nissan on two levels:

● Industrial production: cross-over production of vehicles and components in the Alliance’s manufacturing plants:

- sales by Renault Group to the Nissan group in 2022 totalled approximately €2,015 million (€1,763 million in 2021), comprising around €1,443 million for vehicles (€1,065 million in 2021), €427 million for components (€579 million in 2021), and €145 million for services (€119 million in 2021);

- purchases by Renault Group from the Nissan group in 2022 totalled approximately €1,564

million (€1,559 million in2021), comprising around €1,200 million of vehicles (€1,206 million in 2021), €249 million of components (€226 million in 2021) and €115 million of services (€127 million in 2021);

- the balance of Renault Group receivables on the Nissan group is €504 million at December 31, 2022 (€424 million at December 31, 2021) and the balance of Renault Group liabilities to the Nissan group is €500 million at December 31, 2022 (€607 million at December 31, 2021).

● Finance: In addition to its activity for Renault Group, Renault Finance acts as the Nissan group’s counterparty in financial instrument

trading to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Renault Finance undertook approximately €14.9

billion of forex transactions on the foreign exchange market for Nissan in 2022 (€12.4 billion in 2021). Operations undertaken with Nissan on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are recorded at market price and included in the positions managed by Renault Finance. In the balance sheet, the derivative assets on the Nissan group amount to €188 million at December 31, 2022 (€11 million at December 31, 2021) and derivative liabilities amount to million

€54 at December 31, 2022 (€34 million at December 31, 2021).

The Sales Financing segment has undertaken several public securitization operations (in Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom) and several conduit financing operations (France, the United Kingdom and Germany) loans final customers

involving to and receivables on the dealership network. Both types of operation are

conducted through special purpose vehicles. Some public operations were subscribed by RCI Banque, which makes it possible to have securities eligible as collateralforthe European Central Bank.

In 2022, the Sales Financing segment undertook an operation worth approximately €700 million on the securitization market, backed by automotive loans made by its French subsidiary DIAC (comprising €650 million in senior debt and around €50 million of subordinated debt).

The segment also launched its first securitization in Spain, with creation of €1.1 billion of senior bonds entirely retained by the Group. This new program strengthens the

The receivables assigned through such operations are not derecognized, as all risks are retained by the Group. The associated liabilities correspond to securities resulting from the securitization operations and are recognized in other debts represented by a certificate.

The difference between the receivables assigned and the amount of the associated liabilities corresponds to the higher credit necessary for these operations and the share of securities retained by RCI Banque to form a liquidity reserve.

Securitized assets can no longer be assigned or pledged. Subscribers to debt securities only have claims on the assets assigned.

Assets pledged as guarantees for management of the liquidity reserve are presented in Note 28-A4.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Sales Financing activity is represented by the net book value of sales financing receivables plus

the amount of financing commitments

irrevocable

for customers reported under off-balance sheet commitments given (Note 28-A). This risk is reduced by guarantees provided by customers, as

reported (Note 28-B).

These receivables do not include accounts receivable assigned to the Group’s sales financing companies or other non-Group entities when substantially all the risks benefits of

and associated with ownership risk the receivables are transferred. dilution (essentially risks of the The of non-settlement after a commercial dispute) is retained by the Group, but is considered negligible. Receivables assigned in this way to Group sales financing companies are included in sales financing receivables, principally dealership receivables.

Furthermore, there is no significant concentration of risks within the customer base of the Automotive and Mobility

sales financing receivables amounted to €784 million at December 31, 2022 (€805 million at December 31, 2021).

Customer credit risk is assessed (using a scoring system) and monitored by type of activity (customers and dealers). There is no indication at the year-end that the quality of sales financing receivables not yet due or unimpaired has been adversely affected, nor is there any significant concentration of risks within the sales financing customer base as defined by the regulations.

18-G. Performance share plans and other share-based payments arrangements

The Board of Directors periodically awards performance shares to Group executives and managers, with vesting and minimum holding periods specific to each plan. All plans include performance conditions which determine the number of

performance

shares granted to beneficiaries. Loss of the benefit of performance shares follows the applicable regulations: all rights are forfeited

in the event of resignation or termination and a decision is made for each individual case when an employee leaves at the Company’s instigation.

Performance share plan 29 was introduced in 2022, concerning 1,684 thousand shares with initial total value of €79 million. The vesting period for rights to shares is 3 years and there is no minimum holding period.

Share-based payments have been valued by the methods described in the accounting policies (Note 2-R). The main details are as follows:

Partnership agreements were signed in 2018 with Oyak in Turkey, including put and call options (see Note 28-A3). The Group also holds call options for shares in several entities in the Oyak group (Note 28-B).

There are no significant restrictions on the Group’s capacity to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities, other than restrictions that result from the regulatory framework in which the

Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations

05

19-A. Pension and benefit plans

Pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations essentially concern active employees. These benefits are covered either by defined-contribution plans or defined-benefit plans.

Defined-contribution plans

The Group makes earnings-related payments, in accordance with local custom, to the national organizations responsible for paying pensions and similar financial benefits. There no

is

actuarial

liability

concerning these pension arrangements. The total expense

for defined-contribution plans is €516 million in 2022 (€393 million in 2021).

Defined-benefit plans

The accounting treatment of defined-benefit plans is described in Note 2-S and involves establishment of provisions. These plans concern:

● indemnities payable upon retirement or departure, in application of legislation or agreements in certain countries such as France, Turkey, etc;

● supplementary pensions providing employees with contractual income; the countries applying this type of plan are in Europe (e.g. the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc);

● other long-term benefits, chiefly long-service awards and flexible holiday entitlements.

Defined-benefit supplementary

pension are

plans generally covered by contracts with pension funds or insurance companies. In such cases, the obligations and assets are valued separately. The difference between the obligation and the fair value of the assets held to fund it may indicate underfunding or overfunding. In the event of underfunding, a provision is booked. In the event of overfunding, an asset is recognized subject to certain conditions.

Principal defined-benefit plans of the Group

In France, the Group’s retirement indemnities result from agreements negotiated with each French entity and employee representatives. They are based on employees’ salaries and length of service; payment is conditional on being in the company’s employment at the time of retirement. Retirement benefit obligations for France are entirely covered by provisions and account for most of the Group’s liabilities for retirement indemnities.

The Group’s most significant supplementary pension plan is in the United Kingdom, where two defined-benefit pension plans are managed as part of a dedicated pension

fund comprising two compartments: one concerns Automotive subsidiaries and the other RCI Financial Services Ltd, together covering 1,712 people. This plan has been closed to new members since 2004 and no further rights have been earned under it since December 31, 2019. All employees benefit from a defined-contribution pension plan from January 1, 2020. Underfunding at December 31, 2022 is valued at £38 million for the fund compartment dedicated to the Automotive segment and £5 million for the fund compartment dedicated to RCI Financial Services Ltd.

This pension fund (a trust) is a legal entity. It is administered board

by a of equal

Trustees with representation for the participating companies and their current and former employees. The fund is governed by local regulations, which set the minimum funding requirements that can lead to additional contributions being made by the Group. After the last three-yearly valuation in 2018, the Group made a commitment to cover the funding

shortfall

by 2027 through payments amounting to £5 million maximum per year. The asset investment policy is defined for each section of the fund by a supervisory body which examines the performance of investments quarterly. The risks associated with these plans are the usual risks (lower future returns on fund assets, a decline in the equities markets, longer life expectancy for beneficiaries, a rise in inflation, etc).

23-C. Changes in financial liabilities and sales financing debts

Changes in redeemable shares ofthe Automotive segment

The redeemable shares issued in October 1983 and April 1984 by Renault SA are subordinated perpetual shares listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. They earn a minimum annual return of 9% comprising a 6.75% fixed portion and a variable portion that depends on consolidated revenues and is calculated based on identical Group structure and methods. The sale of our automotive businesses in Russia thus had no effect on this rate of return.

Redeemable shares are stated at amortized cost, calculated by discounting the forecast interest coupons atthe effective interestrate of the borrowing.

These shares traded for €270.58 at December 31, 2022 (€442.00 at December 31, 2021). The financial liability based on the stock market value of the redeemable shares at December 31, 2022 is €216 million (€353 million at December 31, 2021).

Changes in bonds and other debts ofthe Automotive segment

As part of its Shelf Registration program, Renault SA launched two bonds on the

market Japanese on December 22, 2022 for a total of ¥290.7 billion (equivalent to €2 billion). The first bond was launched on July 1, 2022, for total amount of ¥80.7 billion

a (equivalent to €561 million), with a 3.5% coupon and 3-year maturity. The

second was launched on December 22, 2022 for a total amount of ¥210 billion (equivalent to €1.45 billion), with a 2.8% coupon and 4-year maturity.

In 2022, Renault SA redeemed bonds for a total of €207 million.

Change in State-guaranteed creditfacility of the Automotive segment

In 2020, Renault Group opened a credit line with a pool of five banks, for the maximum amount of €5 billion covered by a French State guarantee for up to 90% of the amount borrowed. At December 31, 2020, €4 billion had been drawn on this credit line.

The initial maturity for each drawing was 12 months, extendable by Renault Group for a further three years, with repayment of one third each year. The interest rate on each drawing was indexed on the 12-month Euribor for the first year, then the 6-month Euribor for any extensions. If extended, these credit drawings were repayable in one-third instalments in 2022, 2023 and 2024 on the anniversary dates of the initial drawings, with the possibility of early repayment of outstanding instalments at Renault Group’s initiative.

The Group exercised the extension options on all these drawings except for the drawing maturing in August 2021, of which €1 billion was repaid.

As announced on February 18, 2022, the Group made three

early

repayments 2022

in

totalling €1,020

million,

Financial statements

corresponding to the final instalments (August, September and December 2024) of the three drawings. The change of intent was treated as a modification of a financial liability in compliance with IFRS 9, paragraph B5.4.6. This led to a decrease in the financial liability with recognition of a corresponding amount of €29 million in financial income at December 31, 2022. After the three repayments made at maturity during the second half- year, totalling €990 million, the outstanding amount of the State-guaranteed credit facility at the year-end is €990 million. The total amount will be repaid in 2023.

Changes in Sales Financing debts

On June 27, 2022 the RCI Group issued a €500 million, 5-year green bond with a 4.75% coupon. The proceeds of this issue were received on July 6, 2022. These funds will be used to finance or refinance and electric vehicles charging infrastructures, to promote the transition to electric mobility and the fight against climate change.

In 2022, RCI Banque group also issued new bonds totalling €2,833 million with maturities between 2024 and 2028 and redeemed bonds for a total of €3,319 million.

The Group had access to the TLTRO III program (targeted long-term refinancing operations) set up by the European Central Bank (ECB). Three drawings were made during 2020 for a total of €1,750 million, maturing in 2023. Two other drawings were made during 2021, for a total of €1,500 million, maturing in 2024.

The IFRS IC decision clarifying analysis and recognition of TLTRO III transactions became final in March 2022. This decision applies to drawings of TLTRO III financing to which the Group has opted to apply IFRS 9.

The maximum interest rate applicable to TLTRO drawings is calculated based on the average deposit facility rate

“DFR” of

the

European Rate Central Bank

(ECB). reductions apply based on criteria of growth in loan grants. On June 10, 2022 the Group received confirmation that loan

grant targets for the special additional reference period had been met (October 2020 – December 2021) and that consequently it will benefit from an interest rate reduction (June 2021-June 2022). In application of the

482

provisions of IFRS 9, this rate reduction gives rise to a €14 million adjustment to TLTRO liability items.

New savings collected rose by €3,422 million during the year (€1,938 million of sight deposits and € 1,484 million of term deposits) to €24,441 million (€17,661 million of sight deposits and €6,780 million of term deposits) and are classified as other interest-bearing borrowings. These savings are collected in Germany, Austria, Brazil, Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

To

hedge floating-rate

certain liabilities (savings collected and TLTRO financing), RCI Banque set up interest rate derivatives that do not qualify as hedging derivatives under IFRS 9. The net operating income was positively affected by a €80 million increase in the value of these swaps due to the current rise in interest rates.

Cash out flows on leases

Cash outflows on leases restated in application of IFRS 16 amounted to €170 million in 2022 (€145 million in 2021). This includes €148 million of repayments of the principal value of lease liabilities (€126 million in 2021) and €22 million of interest (€19 million in 2021).

Cash on leases that

outflows

were reclassified

as purchases in substance in application of IAS 16 amounted to €12 million in 2022 (€11 million in 2021). This amount does not include repayments of interest.

Cash outflows on leases benefiting from the exemption for low-value and very short-term leases amounted to €93 million in 2022 (€95 million in 2021) (see Note 5-C).

The potential future cash outflows resulting from the exercise of extension options and contracts already signed which take effect after the 2022 year-end amount to €12 million.

Changes in financial liabilities of the Mobility Services segment

The financial liabilities of the Mobility Services segment consist of internal Group financing issued by Renault s.a.s. in the form of interest-bearing loans.

23-E. Financing by assignment of receivables

Automotive segment financing by assignment of receivables

Some of the Automotive segment’s external financing comes from assignment of commercial receivables to non-Group financial establishments.

Details of financing by assignment of commercial receivables is as follows:

TOTAL ASSIGNED

The total amount of

tax receivables assigned and derecognized in

2022 is €236 million, comprising €136 million of CIR receivables and €100 million of VAT receivables (€139 million of

CIR

receivables and

€66 million of VAT receivables in 2021).

French tax receivables assigned outside the Group (the “CIR” Research Tax Credit), with transfer of substantially all the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the receivables, are only derecognized if the risk of dilution is deemed to be non-existent. This is notably the case when

in the balance sheet December 31, 2022.

The Automotive segment assigns its dealership receivables to the Sales financing segment. The total dealership receivables transferred to the Sales financing segment principally concerns Renault Group. The

amounts are presented in Note 15-D.

Financial instruments by category, fair value and impact on netincome

24-A. Financial instruments by category and fair values by level

IFRS 9 defines three categories of financial instruments:

● financial assets or liabilities at fair value through other components of comprehensive income;

● financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;

● loans and receivables carried at amortized cost.

The following breakdown by level of fair value is presented for financial instruments carried in the balance sheet atfair value:

● level 1: instruments whose fair values are derived from quoted prices in an active market; fair value is generally identical to the most recent quoted price;

● level 2: instruments whose fair values are derived from observable market prices and are not included in level 1;

● level 3: instruments whose fair values are derived from unobservable inputs on the market; the fair value of investments in non-controlled entities is generally based on the share of net assets.

Fair values have been determined on the basis information available at the end of the year and do not therefore take account of subsequent movements.

of

In 2022, no financial instruments were transferred between level 1 and level 2, or into or out of level 3.

(1) The fair value of Sales financing receivables is estimated by discounting future cash flows at rates that would be applicable to similar loans (conditions, maturity and debtor quality) at the year-end. Receivables with a term of less than one year are not discounted, as their fair value does not differ significantly from their net book value. This is a level 3 fair value, as it uses recognized models for which certain significant data, such as the credit risk associated with the portfolio of receivables, are not based on observable market data.

(2) The Group does not report the fair value of financial assets such as Automotive customer receivables, tax receivables or cash and cash equivalents because their net

book value after impairment is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

(1) The Group does not report the fair value of financial liabilities such as trade payables, tax liabilities and social liabilities, because their book value is a reasonable approximation oftheir fair value.

(2) The fair value of Renault and DIAC redeemable shares is identical to the stock market price.

(3) The fair value of the Automotive segment’s financial liabilities and Sales Financing debts measured at amortized cost is essentially determined by discounting future cash flows at rates offered to Renault Group at December 31, 2022 for loans with similar conditions and maturities. The rates offered to Renault Group result from observable market data such as zero-coupon interest rate curves and secondary market prices for bonds issued by the Group, and consequently this is a level 2 fair value.

In the event of default, the non-defaulting party has the right to suspend execution of its payment obligations and to demand payment or transfer of a termination balance for all terminated transactions.

Framework agreements for operations on financial futures and similar agreements

The Group negotiates its derivatives contracts in accordance with the framework agreements issued by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and the FBF (French Banking Federation).

The ISDA and FBF framework agreements do not meet the requirements for netting in the financial statements. The Group currently has no legally enforceable right to net the reported amounts, except in the case of default or a credit event.

25-B. Management of financial risks

The Group is exposed to the following financial risks:

● Liquidity risk;

● Market risks (foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity risks);

● Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing.

Risk management differs depending on the operating segment. The risks described below concern the Automotive segment and the Sales Financing segment. The Mobility Services segment does not have any specific financial risks since it is financed by the Automotive segment.

25-B1. Liquidity risk

The Group must have sufficient financial resources to finance its automotive and sales financing businesses and the investments necessary for their growth. To ensure this is the case, the Automotive and Sales Financing segments borrow on the capital and banking markets to refinance their gross debt and guarantee liquidity. This exposes. them to liquidity risks if markets are closed for long periods or credit is hard to access. The Automotive and Sales Financing segments are also credit-rated by several agencies. Any downgrading of external credit ratings could limit and/or increase the cost of their access to the capital markets.

Liquidity risks – Automotive segment

The Automotive segment’s liquidity risk is managed by the Financing and Treasury department. It is founded on an internal model that defines the level of the liquidity reserve the

Automotive segment must maintain to finance their operations and development. The liquidity reserve

is closely monitored by a monthly review and reported to the Chief Financia l Officer.

Renault SA handles most refinancing for the Automotive segment through long-term resources via the capital markets (bond issues and private placements), short-term NEU CP

financing such as

(Negotiable European Commercial Paper), or bank financing. Renault SA has several debt programs at December 31, 2022:

● An EMTN bond program with a €10 billion ceiling. This program has been registered with the AMF;

● A Shelf Registration bond program on the Japanese market with a ¥400 billion ceiling. This program has been registered with the Japanese stock market authorities (Kanto Local Finance Bureau);

● A NEU CP program with a €2.5 billion ceiling. This program has been registered with the Bank of France.

Renault SA and its debt programs are credit-rated by several agencies. On March 29, 2022 S&P affirmed the rating of BB+ with a negative outlook. Moody’s upgraded the outlook from negative to stable while maintaining the rating at Ba2 on November 18, 2022. The Japanese ratings agencies R&I and JCR affirmed their ratings for Renault SA (R&I: A-, negative outlook on June 3, 2022; JCR: A-, stable outlook on November 22, 2022).

Financial statements

Renault SA maintained its access to the capital markets in 2022 with the issuance of two Samurai bonds. The first of this bonds was issued at the beginning of July 2022 with nominal value of ¥80.7 billion (€561 million) with a 3.5% interest rate and 3-year maturity. The second was issued in December 2022 with nominal value of ¥210 billion (€1.45 billion) with a 2.8% interest rate and 4-year maturity. Renault SA also maintained its access to short-term financing through use of its NEU CP (Negotiable European Commercial Paper) program.

In 2022, Renault SA reimbursed €2,010 million (Note 23-C) of the bank credit facility guaranteed by the French government. This credit facility of an initial €5 billion was set up in 2020 to cover liquidity requirements resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. It was available until December 31, 2020, and three drawings totalling €4 billion were made on it during the second half-year of 2020. The principal outstanding at December 31, 2022 amounts to €990 million. -

Renault SA also has confirmed credit lines opened with banks worth December

€3,430 million at

31, 2022 (3,430 million December 31, 2021). These credit lines mature in more than one year and were undrawn at December 31, 2022 (and 2021). They form a liquidity reserve for the Automotive segment. The maturities of the Automotive segment’s financial liabilities at December 31, 2022 are presented in Note 23-D.

The contractual SA’s confirmed credit arrangements, bank loans and market financing does not contain any clause that could affect the continued supply of credit as a result of changes in either Renault Group’s credit rating or its financial ratios. Certain types of financing, particularly market financing, contain standard clauses (pari passu, negative pledge and cross-default clauses).

At December 31, 2022, the Automotive segment have a liquidity reserve of €17.7 billion, sufficient to cover their commitments over a 12-month

horizon. This reserve consists of €14.23 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and €3.43 billion of unused confirmed credit lines.

Liquidity risks –Sales Financing segment

The Sales Financing segment is very attentive to diversification of its sources of liquidity. In recent years Renault Group has diversified widely its sources of financing, moving into new distribution zones in addition to its longstanding base of Euro bond investors.

RCI Banque’s liquidity risk management follows the recommendations of the European Banking Authority. It

uses several indicators and analyses (static liquidity, liquidity reserve, several stress scenarios), which are

490 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

updated and

reported

to

RCI

Banque’s Financial Committee on a monthly basis. The stress scenarios include assumptions concerning deposit leakage, loss of access to new financing, partial unavailability of certain elements of the liquidity reserve and forecasts for issuance of new credit.

The alternation of different maturities and issue formats is part of the Sales Financing segment’s diversification strategy for financing sources. This policy has been followed for several years and enables the segment to reach the maximum number of investors.

The Group took advantage of the favorable context early in the year to issue €750 million of debt with a term of 3.5 years as a part of EMTN program (Euro Medium Term Note Program). This operation generated an order book of over €4.5 billion from more than 180 investors. The Group also returned to the Swiss market, placing a CHF 110 million bond with 3-year maturity. In June, the bank successfully completed its first green bond issue, totalling €500 million. The proceeds of this issue will be used to finance or refinance electric vehicles and charging infrastructures. This operation demonstrated the Group’s determination to promote the transition to electric mobility and fight climate change. In September, when the markets were still volatile, a €650 million 6-year bond was also issued. In November, when the market was particularly favorable, a €750 million 3-year bond was also issued.

On the securitization market, the Group placed approximately €700 million of securities backed by automotive loans made by its French subsidiary DIAC, and increased its private securitization in England by £100 million.

Against high volatility on the markets, collection of new savings was particularly resilient and competitive in terms of the cost of resources collected compared to market finance sources. Customer

deposits by

increased €2.1 billion over the year to €23.1 billion.

With these resources, as well as €4.4 billion of undrawn confirmed credit lines with banks, €4.6 billion of collateral eligible for the Central Banks’ monetary policy operations, €5.8 billion of highly liquid assets (HQLA), RCI Banque is able maintain its financing for almost 11 months without access to external - to customer liquidities. At December 31, 2022, RCI Banque’s liquidity reserve (for the Europe scope) amounts to €14.9 billion (€14.4 billion at December 31, 2021).

The RCI Banque group’s issues and programs are credit- rated by several agencies. In 2022, S&P confirmed RCI Banque’s rating of BBB- with a stable outlook, while Moody’s affirmed its rating of Baa2 but changed the outlook from negative to stable on November 22, 2022.

25-B2. Foreign exchange risk

The Group made no major changes to its foreign exchange risk management policy in 2022.

The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk principally concerns the Automotive segment.

Foreign exchange risks - Automotive segment

In the Automotive segment, fluctuations in exchange rates

can affect the following financial aggregates: operating income (loss), financial income (expenses), share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures, shareholders’ equity and net cash position.

The Performance and Control Department and the Financing and Treasury Department are in charge of rolling out and monitoring the Automotive segment’s foreign exchange risk management policy.

Operating income

The Automotive segment sometimes hedges certain

positions. Foreign exchange hedges on operating income and

expenses must first be analysed by the Performance and Control

Department and the Financing and Treasury Department, and then require formal authorization by the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer, with monthly reporting of results to the Chief Finance Officer. Wherever possible, foreign exchange operations are mainly undertaken by the Group’s trading room (Renault Finance) for currencies that are negotiable on the international markets.

05

The principal exposure to foreign exchange risks lies in the operating income (loss). At December 31, 2022 based on the 2022 structure of operating results and cash flows, a 1% rise by the euro against all other currencies would have an unfavorable impact of €11 million on the Automotive segment’s annual operating income (loss) after any hedging.

In 2022, to limit the foreign exchange risk exposure of its operating margin, the Automotive segment set up foreign exchange hedges of the Argentinian peso, Chinese yuan, and Turkish lira.

The principal exposure in 2022 concerned the pound sterling and the Chinese yuan, with a unfavorable impact of approximately €(15) million and favrable impact of approximately €11 million respectively in the event of a 1% rise by the euro against these currencies, after eventual hedging.

Financial income (expenses)

To avoid any exchange–related distortion of the net financial income, it is the Automotive segment’s policy to minimize the foreign exchange risk affecting financing and investmentitems in foreign currencies.

All

the Automotive segment’s exposures to foreign exchange risks on financial income and expense items

are aggregated and monitored by the Financing and Treasury Department, with monthly reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.

Intra-group financing flows in foreign currency are hedged in the same currency. If a subsidiary needs external financing in a currency other than the local

currency, the parent company monitors the operations closely. Cash surpluses in countries that are not part of the parent company’s centralized cash management are generally invested in local currency, under the supervision of the Group’s Financing and Treasury Department. The subsidiary Renault Finance can

undertake foreign exchange operations on its own behalf, within strictly defined risk limits. Its foreign exchange positions are monitored and valued in real time. This activity is chiefly

intended to

maintain the Group’s expertise on the financial markets. It generates very short exposures and does not exceed a few tens of millions of euros, so that it cannot have a significant impact on Renault Group’s consolidated results.

Renault Group Financial statements

Share in the net income of associates and joint ventures

The share in the net income of associates and joint ventures is exposed to foreign exchange risks. On the basis of its contribution to 2022 net income, a 1% rise in the euro against the Japanese yen would have decreased Nissan’s contribution €5 by

million. This impact corresponds only to the impact of the euro on the translation of Nissan’s contribution to the Renault Group’s consolidated statements. It does not reflect the inherent impact of euro fluctuations on Nissan’s own accounts, given that Nissan does varying levels of business in the Euro zone and Renault Group has no control over this.

Equity investments

The foreign exchange risk exposure of equity investments (in currencies other than the euro) is not generally hedged. However, due to its importance, the investment in Nissan is subject to a partial foreign exchange hedge amounting to ¥199.9 billion at December 31, 2022 (¥18.3 billion at December 2021) (Note 12-G). In 2022 the Group amended its management rule restricting hedging of its net investment in Nissan to its best estimate of the next three years of dividends in yen to be received from Nissan. The Group can now decide to hedge a higher amount of its exposure to foreign exchange risks through the share of equity held in Nissan than the above estimate, although it cannot exceed the share in yen of Nissan equity and its assessment of the liquidity risk on the yen. This foreign currency hedge is only a limited part of the investment in Nissan.

Net cash position

For the purposes of the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan, some of net

Renault Group’s financial indebtedness is denominated in yen. At December 31, 2022 a 1% rise in the euro against the yen would increase the net cash

position of the Automotive segment by €14 million. This net cash position may also be impacted by changes in exchange rates concerning subsidiaries’ financial assets and liabilities in their local currency.

Analysis of financial instruments’ sensitivity to foreign exchange risks

This analysis concerns the sensitivity to foreign exchange risks of monetary assets and liabilities (including intra- Group balances) and derivatives denominated in a currency other than the currency of the entity that holds them. However, it does not cover items (hedged assets or liabilities and

derivatives)

concerned by fair value hedging, for which changes in fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument totally offset each other in the income statement.

The impact on shareholders’ equity (before tax) of a 1% rise in the euro against other currencies is assessed by converting financial assets, cash flow hedges and the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan. For the Automotive segment, this impact would be a favorable €14 million at December 31, 2022 (€1 million at December 31,

492

2021), explained by the yen bond issues that make up the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan (see Note 12-G).

The impact on net income of a 1% rise in the euro against other currencies would be an unfavorable impact of €5 million at December 31, 2022 (€2 million at December 31, 2021), mainly attributable to unhedged operating assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the entity that holds them.

Foreign exchange risk - Sales Financing segment

The Sales Financing segment has low exposure to foreign exchange risks due to the management principles applied. No position can be taken under the central management framework for refinancing; the trading room

hedges all flows concerned. Residual, temporal positions in foreign currencies related to the time differences in cash flows inherent to multi-currency cash management may still remain. They are monitored daily and the same hedging policy applies. The Sales Financing subsidiaries are obliged to obtain refinancing in their own currency and as a result are not exposed. In exceptional circumstances, limits are assigned to subsidiaries where sales financing activities or refinancing take place in several different currencies, and

to subsidiaries authorized to invest some of their cash surpluses in a currency other than their local currency.

At December 31, 2022 RCI Banque group’s consolidated foreign exchange position reached €12.7 million.

25-B3. Interest rate risks

The Group made no major changes to its interest rate risk management policy in 2022.

The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk principally concerns the Sales Financing segment.

Interest rate risk - Automotive segment

The Automotive segment’s net financial income is exposed to a risk of variations in market interest rates affecting its cash surpluses and financial liabilities, and to a lesser degree its shareholders’ equity.

The interest rate risk management policy applies the following principles:

● Liquidity reserves are generally established using floating-rate financing. The Automotive segment’s available cash is managed centrally by Renault SA as far as possible and invested by Renault Finance in the form of short term bank deposits and mutual funds approved as money market funds and meeting the criteria for classification as cash equivalents

● Long-term investments by the Automotive segment generally use fixed-rate financing.

Interest rate hedging instruments for the Automotive segment are standard interest swaps that are adequately covered by hedged liabilities, such that no ineffectiveness is expected.

Finally, Renault Finance carries

out transactions on its own behalf, within strictly defined risk limits, and positions are monitored and valued in real time.

The risk associated with this arbitrage activity is very limited, and has no significant impact on the Group’s consolidated netincome.

Interest rate risk – Sales Financing segment

The overall interest rate risk represents the impact of fluctuating rates on the future gross financial margin. RCI Banque’s operating by

results may

be affected movements in market interest rates or interest rates applicable to customer deposits. The Sales Financing segment’s aim is to limit these risks as far as possible in orderto protect its margin on sales.

To take account of the difficulty of precisely matching the structure of borrowings with the structure of loans, a limited amount of flexibility is allowed in each subsidiary’s interest rate hedging. This flexibility is reflected in a sensitivity limit assigned to each subsidiary and validated by the finance committee, in an individual adaptation of part of the limit Renault Group assigns to the Sales Financing segment.

A daily sensitivity calculation by currency, management entity, and asset portfolio is used to ensure that each entity respects its assigned limits. All RCI Banque entities use the same method for this assessment of interest rate sensitivity, which measures the impact of a 100 base point increase in interest rates on the value of balance sheet items for each entity. Sensitivity is calculated daily for each currency and each management entity (central refinancing office, French and foreign sales financing subsidiaries) for the purpose of overall management of interest rate risks across the consolidated scope of the Sales Financing segment.

Each entity’s position with regard to its limit is checked daily, and immediate hedging directives are issued to the subsidiaries if circumstances require. The results of the checks are reported monthly to the Sales Financing segment’s Finance Committee, which checks that the positions comply with the Group’s financial strategy and current procedural instructions.

Analysis of the Sales Financing segment’s structural interestrate risk shows the following:

● Virtually all loans to customers by Sales Financing subsidiaries bear interest at a fixed rate and have terms from one to seventy-two months. These loans are hedged by fixed-rate resources with the same structure. They are covered by macro-hedging and only generate a residual interest rate risk. In subsidiaries where the financing bears interest at a floating rate, the interest rate risk is hedged by macro-hedging using interest rate swaps.

● The main activity of the Sales Financing segment’s central refinancing department is refinancing the segment’s sales subsidiaries. The outstanding credit issued by Sales Financing subsidiaries is backed by fixed-interest resources, some of which are micro- hedged by interest rate swaps, and floating-rate

interest resources. Macro-hedging transactions in the form of

rate swaps keep the sensitivity of the refinancing holding company below the limit set by the Group (€32 million). These macro-hedging transactions

05

concern floating-rate resources and/or fixed-rate resources converted to floating-rate resources by micro-hedging of swaps.

Analysis of Group financial instruments’ sensitivity to interest rate risks

The Automotive

and Sales

Financing segments are exposed to the following interest rate risks:

● variations in the interest flows on floating-rate financial instruments stated at amortized cost (including fixed- instruments

rate to and structured products);

swapped

floating rate,

● variations in the fair value

of fixed-rate financial

instruments stated at fair value;

● variations in the fair value of derivatives.

Impacts are estimated by applying a 100 base point rise in interest rates over a one-year period to financial instruments reported in the closing statement of financial position.

For Sales segment,

the Financing the impact on shareholders’ equity corresponds to the change in fair value before reclassification in profit or loss (section 2) of fixed-rate debt instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through other components of comprehensive income and cash flow hedges after a 100 base point rise in interest rates. All other impacts affect net income.

Calculation of the individual segments’ sensitivity to interest rates includes

intersegment loans and borrowings.

For the Automotive segment, the impact on net income of a 100 base point rise in interest rates applied to financial instruments exposed to interest rate risks would be a favorable €97.9 million. Shareholders’ equity would be unaffected.

For the Sales Financing segment, the overall sensitivity to interest rate risks in 2022 remained below the limit set by the RCI Banque group (€70 million at December 31, 2022). At December 31, 2022, a 100 base point rise in interest rates would have the following impacts on net income and shareholders’ equity (before taxes):

● +€1.1 million for items denominated in Moroccan dirham;

● €(0.3) million for items denominated in Swiss francs;

● +€1 million for items denominated in pounds sterling;

● €(0.3) million for items denominated in Russian rouble;

● €(1.6) million for items denominated in euros;

● +€0.3 million for items denominated in Czech koruna;

The sum of the absolute sensitivities in each currency amounts to €7 million.

Management of commodity risk

Commodity purchase prices can change suddenly and significantly, and cannot necessarily be passed on through vehicle sale

prices. This may lead Renault Group’s Purchases department to hedge part of its commodity risks using financial instruments. These hedges are subject to volume, duration, and price limits. The subsidiary Renault Finance can undertake metal operations on its own behalf, within strictly defined risk limits. Its positions are monitored and valued in real time and do not qualify as hedging. This activity cannot have a significant impact on Renault Group’s consolidated results.

In 2022 Renault Group undertook hedging operations on metals

base and precious metals, within the limits validated by the CEO of Renault SA.

The operations in progress at December 31, 2022 are classified for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges, and accordingly changes in their fair value are included in other components of comprehensive income to the extent of the effective portion of the hedges.

Analysis of financial instruments’ sensitivity to commodity risks

Financial instruments’

accounting sensitivity to commodity risks results from derivatives used to hedge the Group’s economic exposure to these risks.

A 10% increase in commodity prices for derivatives designated as hedging derivatives would have a positive impact of €96 million on other

components

comprehensive income at December 31, 2022.

25-B6. Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing

Customercredit risk on Automotive receivables

The Automotive segment’s exposure to credit risk is limited because of the assignment of many receivables leading to their deconsolidation, and systematic hedging of risks on export receivables. Non-assigned sales receivables and receivables covered by guarantee are regularly monitored.

Credit risk on customers, dealers and commitments given by the Sales Financing segment

The Sales Financing segment is exposed to customer and dealer credit risk when risk management techniques are insufficient for protection against default on payment by its counterparties.

Credit risk is the risk of losses due to the incapacity of RCI Banque customers to fulfil the terms of a contract signed with the bank. Credit risk is closely linked to macro- economic factors including the unemployment rate, corporate bankruptcies, debt servicing costs, revenue growth, disposable household

income, dealership profitability and the price of used vehicles. It has a significant impact on the Sales Financing segment’s business.

The level of credit risk on the dealership network is influenced by the dealers’ financial health, the quality of guarantees, and the general demand for vehicles.

RCI Banque uses advanced scoring systems and external databases to evaluate the quality of loans made to retail and business customers. It also uses an internal rating system to evaluate lending to dealers. Although RCI Banque is constantly adjusting its acceptance policy in response to market conditions, any increase in the credit risk would increase its cost of risk and its provisions for bad debt. RCI Banque has detailed procedures to recover receivables that are compromised or in default, arranging repossessions and sales of unpaid vehicles. However, there can be no guarantee that the policies of issuing credit, monitoring credit risk, payment recovery action, and repossession of vehicles are, or will be, sufficient to avoid an unfavorable impact on its financial results and position.

An increase in the credit risk would increase the cost of risk and provisions for bad debt, with a direct impact on RCI’s financial results and potentially on its internal capital.

Bank counterparty risk

Due to its operations on the financial markets to invest cash surpluses, manage foreign exchange risks and interest risks, and manage payment flows, the Group is exposed to a bank counterparty risk.

This bank counterparty risk affecting Group entities is managed by both the Automotive and Sales Financing segment in a fully-coordinated approach. It is founded on an internal rating system based mainly on counterparties’ long- term credit ratings and equity. This system is used by all Renault Group companies exposed toa bank counterparty risk.

Group companies which, due to the nature of their business, a

are significantly exposed

to bank counterparty risk are monitored daily to ensure that they comply with authorized counterparty limits, in accordance with specific procedures. The Group produces a consolidated monthly report covering all its bank counterparties, organized by credit rating. This report provides a detailed analysis of compliance with limits in terms of amount, maturity and type, as well as a list of the main exposures.

To reduce the bank counterparty risk, most deposits are contracted with large network banks and generally have terms shorter than 90 days, as this allows a good spread of the risk. In the event of volatile macroeconomic situations that may arise in emergent countries and potentially affect their banking systems, the Group introduces an action plan to step up counterparty risk monitoring, and makes adjustments to the counterparty limits if necessary. The exposure on each banking group is assessed monthly on a consolidated basis, with the Automotive and Sales Financing entities. The Group is not subject to any significant risk concentration for its operations on the financial and banking markets.

No losses due to default by a bank counterparty were recorded in 2022. The bank counterparty risk borne by the Group through its shares in investment funds (UCITS) is incorporated into the risk of changes in value for those products, and monitored using specific rules.

Multi-year supply commitments will give rise to cash outflows over a period of 12 years starting from the 2022 year-end. The maximum payable within one year is €485 million at

December 31, 2022 (€300 million at December 31, 2021). Irrevocable commitments at December 31, 2022 were essentially made to secure raw material supplies.

28-A2. Contingentliabilities

Group companies

are periodically subject to tax inspections in the countries in which they operate. Accepted tax adjustments are recorded as provisions in the financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful.

Tax liabilities are recognized via provisions when

there

are uncertainties over the determination oftaxes.

On December 19, 2019 Renault s.a.s. received notification, interrupting the limitation period, of a tax reassessment on transfer prices in 2016, and an additional notification was received on June 24, 2021 concerning the years 2017 and 2018. On December 21, 2022, the French tax authorities issued a proposed reassessment for the year 2019 relating to a further inspection covering the period 2019-2020, also interrupting the relevant limitation period. Renault Group is challenging the most significant amounts of these notifications, and no provision has been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2022 in connection with this matter.

RESA (Renault España SA) was notified in late 2020 of a €213 million tax reassessment for transfer prices, which Renault Group is contesting. A procedure for amicable settlement between France and Spain was begun in 2021. No provision has been recognized in connection with this notification, since Renault Group considers that it has good chances of winning its case. A deposit of €213 million was paid to the Spanish tax authorities (€135 million in 2020 and €78 million in 2021), recognized in non-current

financial assets and presented in cash flows from investing activities (under Decrease (Increase) in loans of the Automotive segment) in the consolidated cash flow

statement. The Spanish tax authorities are currently conducting an inspection of the years 2017 to 2020.

Disposals of subsidiaries or businesses by the Group generally include representations and warranties in the buyer's favour. At December 31, 2022, the Group has not identified any significant risk in connection with these operations.

In the ongoing “emissions” affair in France, in which a formal legal investigation was opened on January 12, 2017 at the request of the Paris public prosecution office, Renault s.a.s. was officially placed under investigation for deceit on June 8, 2021.

In July 2021 Renault Group paid bail of €20 million (included in the balance sheet) to guarantee its representation throughout the proceedings and to cover payment of any damages and fines. It also issued a €60 million bank guarantee on October 8, 2021 to cover compensation for any prejudice identified. Renault Group denies having committed any offence. All Renault Group vehicles are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with applicable laws and The potential

regulations.

of

the next in ongoing consequences steps these proceedings cannot be reliably estimated, and no provision was recognized in connection with this matter at December 31, 2022 (nor at December 31, 2021).

Approximately 80% of the Group’s 2022 sales were subject to CO2 emission regulations, principally in the European Union but also notably in the United Kingdom, South Korea and Brazil.

In 2020,2021 and 2022, the three members of the Alliance - Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. – signed agreements to pool their CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) targets for the European Union. The potential noncompliance penalties payable to the authorities concerned are determined at the level of the group formed by the Alliance’s three automakers. Renault did not recognize any provision in connection with the EU CAFE regulation at December 31, 2022 (nor at December 31, 2021 and December 31,2020).

Renault Group confirmed in a press release of January 17, 2022 that it had achieved its CAFE targets for passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles in 2021 (these results are due to be consolidated and officialized by the European Commission in the next few months). Based on the estimates available for 2022, the 2022 targets should also be met.

A provision of €10 million was recognized for CAFE penalties payable for 2022 in South Korea (€11 million in 2021), raising the total provision for the years 2019 to 2022 to €45 million.

Group companies are also subject to the applicable regulations regarding pollution, notably of soil and ground water. These regulations vary depending on the country of location. Some of the associated environmental liabilities are potential and will only be recognized in the accounts if the activity is discontinued or the site closed. It is also sometimes difficult to determine the amount of the obligation reliably. Provisions are only established for liabilities that correspond to a legal or constructive obligation at the closing date, and can be estimated with reasonable reliability.

The Group establishes provisions for its products recycling under regulatory requirements, when the practical organization of recycling operations is defined. In France, the “AGEC” law of February 10, 2020 to fight waste and promote a circular economy was adopted to

extend industrial operators’ legal responsibility for management of their waste. Renault Group’s obligation

was increased by this law and its implementing decree 2022-1495 which applies to all vehicles on the road. A study is in progress to determine the amount of the obligation. No provision was recognized in connection with this matter at December 31, 2022.

On 15 March 2022, the European Commission conducted inspections at the premises of companies and associations active in the automotive sector located in several EU Member States. In parallel, the European Commission has sent out formal requests for information to several companies active the sector.

in automotive The investigation concerns possible anticompetitive collusion in relation to the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life (ELV) cars and vans, relating in particular to (i) the compensation of ELV collection, treatment, and recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in advertising materials.

Renault was one of the companies visited on 15 March 2022. In parallel, Renault has received a request for information from

the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is investigating similar conduct. Renault has replied to the European Commission’s and the CMA’s requests for information.

The possible consequences of the ongoing investigation cannot be reliably estimated at this stage and no provision in connection with this matter has been recorded at December 31, 2022.

28-A3. Share purchase commitments given

When

the

Group

grants

put options

to minority shareholders to sell their investments in fully consolidated companies, a liability corresponding to the option is recognized, with a reduction in shareholders’ equity – non- controlling interests’ share.

Put options granted by the Group to minority shareholders

concern Banco RCI Brasil

S.A, Rombo Compania Financiera, RCI Colombia S.A and RCI Financial Services s.r.o. The consequences for the financial statements are explained in Note 18-H.

Partnership agreements were signed in 2018 with Oyak in Turkey, including perfectly symmetrical put and call options for non-controlling investments, entitling Renault

500

s.a.s., subject to certain conditions, to purchase Oyak’s shares in Oyak Renault (call) and to sell its shares in MAIS (put), and entitling Oyak to sell its shares in Oyak Renault (put) and purchase Renault s.a.s.’s shares in MAIS (call). The exercise price for the put option, if exercised, will be determined by three independent experts who would be appointed at the exercise date. Analysis of the contracts did not identify any circumstances beyond the control of Renault Group that could lead to Oyak’s put option exercised without Renault Group being able to object. Consequently, no liability was recognized at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2022 in connection with these options.

28-A4. Assets pledged as guarantees for management of the liquidity reserve

For management of its liquidity reserve, the Sales Financing segment has access to the monetary policy operations of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE).

To benefit from European Central Bank monetary policy operations, the segment has provided guarantees to the Banque de France (under France’s central collateral management system 3G - Gestion Globale des Garanties) in the form of assets with book value of €8,907 million at December 31, 2022 (€7,111 million at December 31, 2021). These assets securitization comprise €7,647 million of shares in vehicles and

€1,260 million of sales financing (€6,628

receivables million of shares in securitization vehicles, €3 million of euro bonds and €480 million of sales financing receivables at December 31, 2021). The financing provided by the Banque de France against these guarantees amounts to €3,250 million at December 31, 2022 (€3,738 million at December 31, 2021).

To benefit from Bank of England monetary policy operations, the Sales Financing segment has provided guarantees to the Bank of England’s TFSME (Term Funding Scheme for SMEs) in the form of assets with book value of £712 million (€803 million) consisting of a self-subscribed securitization program and a bond. The financing received from the Bank

of

these guarantees amounts to England against €465 million at December 31, 2022. All assets provided as guarantees to the Banque de France and the Bank of England remain in the balance sheet.

Commitments received – share purchase options

The Group has a call option to increase its investment in Whylot to 70% and take control of the company by 2023 (Note 3). This option is conditional on Whylot achieving certain objectives, and is not exercisable at December 31, 2022. No liability is recognized in connection with this commitment.

The Group holds derivative instruments to subscribe to future capital increases by Verkor, without taking control of the company. No liability is recognized in connection with this commitment.

The agreement for the sale by Renault Group of its investments in Renault Russia and the Avtovaz Group, which took place on May 15, 2022, gives Renault Group an option to buy back its investment in Lada Auto holding

Note 29

Subsequent events

Renault Group has announced on February, 06th 2023 the signing of a binding framework agreement defining the principles of a new governance structure and the rebalancing of cross-shareholdings between Renault Group and Nissan. The two companies plan to conclude a new agreement by March 31, 2023 that will replace the current agreements governing the Alliance. The new agreement would be effective for an initial period of 15 years.

Renault Group would transfer 28.4% of Nissan shares into where the

a French trust, voting rights would be “neutralized” for most of the decisions, but the economic rights (dividends and shares’ sale proceeds) would still entirely benefit to Renault Group until such shares are

(the parent company of Avtovaz), exercisable during three 90-day periods starting on May 15, 2024, 2026 and 2028. The exercise price of this option is one rouble, plus a

commitment by Renault

make a

Group to cash contribution to Avtovaz over 4 years, of an amount to be determined at Renault Group’s discretion by reference to the sum of non-refundable subsidies received from the Russian State, cash contributions to assets and/or the share capital of Avtovaz, and the accumulated profits of the Avtovaz Group calculated under IFRS between the date of Renault’s sale of its investment in Avtovaz and the date at which the repurchase option is exercised.

The of this

amount contribution will determine ownership interest acquired by Renault Group (between

the 51% and 67.69%). A €400

million contribution will automatically give the Group a 51% investment.

The derivative corresponding to this option has nil value at December 31, 2022.

sold. Renault Group and Nissan would retain a 15% cross- shareholding, with a lock-up obligation, as well as a standstill obligation. They would both be able to freely exercise the voting rights attached to their 15% direct shareholding, with a 15% cap. Renault Group would instruct the trustee to sell the entrusted Nissan shares if

for Renault Group

a commercially reasonable in coordinated and orderly process, but it would have no obligation to sell the shares within a specific pre- determined period of time. The Alliance Operating Board would remain the coordination forum.

This announcement has no impact on the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022.

5.2.3.1. Statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements

Forthe year ended December 31, 2022

To the Annual General Meeting of Renault S.A.,

Opinion

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Renault for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risks Committee.

Basis for Opinion

Audit Framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements”section of our report.

Independence

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1st, 2022 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.

Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.

Valuation of equity investments

Risk identified

At December 31, 2022, equity investments are composed by “investments stated at equity” and “other investments”, and are accounted for in Renault balance sheet for 14,249 million euros, representing one of the most significant caption of the total assets.

With respect to Renault’s investments in fully controlled companies, Renault has opted for the equity method. Their value in the balance sheet is determined on the basis of the share of each of these companies, fully consolidated, in the shareholders' equity determined according to the rules of consolidation, without taking into account the elimination of transactions between group companies. The annual change in the overall share of shareholders' equity corresponding to these interests is recorded in shareholders' equity under “Equity valuation difference”. When the “equity valuation difference” becomes negative, a provision for overall depreciation is accounted in the income statement.

Other investments, i.e. investments in non-exclusively controlled companies, are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition cost, excluding incidental purchase expenses, and mainly concern Renault's investment in Nissan. They are valued at the lower of acquisition cost or book value, taking into account the share of net assets and the profitability prospects. When the book value of the securities is lower than the gross value, a depreciation is recorded for the amount of the difference.

The assessment of the recoverable value of Renault’s investment in Nissan requires judgement from management. As stated in note 4.1 of the financial statements, an impairment test was carried out on December 31, 2022, on the basis of profitability assumptions consistent with Nissan's historical data and with future medium and long term prudent assumption taking into accountthe new medium-term volume and exchange rate forecasts.

In this context, we have considered that the valuation of the investments was a key audit matter due to their importance in the company's financial statements and management's estimates and judgments necessary to determine the value in use of equity interests, particularly with regards to Renault's stake in Nissan.

Our audit response

We have reviewed the methodology used by management to determine the equity value of equity securities of companies controlled exclusively and the value in use of other equity securities and examined the methods for implementing the impairmenttest as described in notes 2.1 of the annual financial statements.

In order to assess the reasonableness of the value in use of equity investments, we mainly relied on the work performed for the purpose of the consolidated financial statement audit. Our work mainly consisted in:

Regarding Renault’s investments in controlled companies:

● Check that the shareholders' equity in each of these investments corresponds to their contribution to the consolidated equity of Renault,

● Check that Renault has performed the necessary adjustments, if any, to take into account potential impairment losses accounted for in the group’s consolidated financial statements.

Regarding Renault’s investment in Nissan:

● Assessing whether there are any identified impairment indicators, the main indicators being significant adverse changes on markets where Nissan operates or a significant and long lasting drop in Nissan stock market value.

● Examining the relevance of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable value of its investment in Nissan, by reference to Nissan mid-term plan, historical performance achieved by Nissan as well as the overall perspectives ofthe Automotive sector.

● Understanding the conclusions and the work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan regarding the impairment testin accordance with our instructions which detail the procedures to be performed.

● Assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in the notes to the individual financial statements.

Specific Verifications

We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.

Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders

We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.

Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

● Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, orthe override of internal control.

● Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.

● Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.

● Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

● Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Reportto the Audit Committee

We submit to the Audit and Risks Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit and Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risks Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

With the French State, shareholder of your Company

Persons concerned

Mr Thomas Courbe and Mr Alexis Zajdenweber, Board members of your Company representing the French State.

Governance Agreement

Nature and purpose

On December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a “Governance Agreement” between Renault and the French State which aims to regulate the exercise of voting rights attached to the Renault S.A. shares held by the French State.

Conditions

Pursuant to the authorization granted by your Board of Directors, on February 4, 2016 and by your Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2016, your Company has signed concurrently with the French State a Governance Agreement under which the voting rights attached to the French State’s shares exceeding a certain percentage of Renault's total exercisable rights (set at 17.9% in the event of a "usual" quorum, or at 20% in the event of a particularly high quorum) are, in certain cases, exercised in a neutral manner, that is to say in such a way that they do not affect the adoption or rejection of the resolutions concerned by the limitation. The written agreement also describes the conditions for implementing these restrictions with the registrar of Renault S.A.

The restriction to the free exercise of voting rights of the French State notably applies to all decisions which fall within the authority of the Ordinary Annual General Meeting, except for decisions concerning (i) dividend distributions, (ii) the appointment, renewal or removal from office of Board members representing the French State, (iii) the disposal of significant Company’s assets, (iv) related-party agreements that are not approved by the representatives of the French State and (v) buybacks of shares from identified shareholders.

However, the French State retains all of its voting rights for decisions which fall within the authority of the Extraordinary Annual General Meeting, except for the most day-to-day decision-making such as (i) the granting or renewal of ongoing delegations to the management bodies of your Company when their conditions comply with the latter’s existing practices,

(ii) the granting of stock options, performance shares or shares that give access to the share capital to the benefit of employees and executive corporate officer of the Renault Group, (iii) an amendment to the age limit for the exercise of duties or to the term of office of Board members and executive corporate officer and (iv) a transfer of registered office (unless abroad).

The restrictions to the free exercise of voting rights would cease to apply in exceptional situations such as the amendment or termination of the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement” (see below), the exercise by Nissan Motor Co. Ltd of voting rights in your Company, the announcement of a public offering on your Company’s shares, or a shareholder exceeding the threshold of 15% in your Company’s capital or voting rights, including Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.

The governance agreement is completed by a technical agreement, describing more precisely conditions of the implementation of these restrictions with the registrar of Renault S.A.

The governance agreement was concluded on April 4, 2016, for a period of 20 years and is renewable by tacit agreement for successive periods of ten years unless it is terminated at least two years before the expiry of the term.

With Nissan Motor Co. Ltd ("Nissan")

Persons concerned

Ms. Yu Serizawa and Mr Joji Tagawa, members of your Company’s Board appointed upon proposal of Nissan.

"Restated Alliance Master Agreement"

On March 28, 2002, your Company and Nissan entered into the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement”, which governs the share capital relationship between your Company and Nissan and regulates the Alliance’s current governance. This agreement specifies the operational terms and conditions of Renault-Nissan B.V. (“RNBV”) as the corporate entity involved in defining the Alliance’s strategy.

An initial amendment to the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement” was signed on April 29, 2005 and submitted for the approval of the Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2006.

In its meeting of October 3, 2012, your Board of Directors authorized the signature, on November 7, 2012, of a second amendment to the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement”, which modifies the composition of the RNBV Executive Board and as a result, the voting arrangements within the Executive Board. This amendment was submitted to the approval of your general meeting of April 30, 2013.

In its meeting on December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the signature of a governance agreement between your Company and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. concerning the governance of Nissan Motor Co., which constitutes a third amendment to the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement”.

The conditions of this third amendment concern your Company’s undertaking (i) to vote in favour of the resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors of Nissan to the Annual General Meeting of Nissan for the appointment, dismissal and compensation of the members of the Board of Directors of Nissan (other than the members appointed upon proposal of your Company, (ii) not to submit a resolution to the Annual General Meeting of Nissan that would not have been approved by the Board of Directors of Nissan , and (iii) not to vote in favour of a resolution that would not be supported by the Board of Directors of Nissan.

For these resolutions, your Company remains free to vote as it sees fit, however, in the event that your Company does not comply with its commitment, Nissan may acquire Renault’s shares without the prior approval of your Board of Directors, notwithstanding the provisions of the Restated Alliance Agreement which prevent the parties from increasing, without prior agreement, their respective holdings. The amendment modifies the “Restated Alliance Master Agreement” without altering its term, which remains indefinite. It has been applicable since it was entered into. This agreement has been approved by the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2016.

5.2.4.2. Notes to the financial statements

The following disclosures constitute the notes to the balance sheet at 31 December 2022, before appropriation of net profit for the year, which shows total assets of €34 535 million and to the income statement for the year then ended, which shows net profit of €364 million.

The financial statements cover the twelve-month period from 1January to 31 December 2022.

The financial statements for 2022 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors’ meeting of Renault S.A. on 15 February 2023.

These financial

statements are included in

the

consolidated financial statements of Group Renault.

5.2.4.2.1. Significant events

Nissan’s exercise ended on 31 March 2022 with a net profit of €1,598 million (Y216 billion) and Renault S.A. received €64 million (Y9 billion) dividend from Nissan during 2022.

To maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for its operations, in 2022 the Group issued two bonds the Japanese market as part of Renault’s Shelf Registration program, for a total of ¥290.7 billion. And the Group made €2,010 million repayment in 2022 of its State-guaranteed credit facility. At the date of publication of these consolidated financial statements, the Group has sufficient cash and sources of financing to ensure continuity of operations for the next twelve months and has demonstrated its capacity to issue debt.

To engage all employees in the Group’s new strategy and future performance as in-depth changes are being made,

516

Renault Group launched Renaulution Shareplan, an employee shareholding operation attributing 6 free shares to more than 95 000 employees across

22 countries. In 21 countries, the plan also offers employees the opportunity to buy shares at a 30% discount. As the reference share price in the Renaulution Shareplan is set at €31.46, the discounted share price is €22.02. The cost of this plan has been recognized in the 2022 financial statements.

At the General Shareholders’ Meeting of May 25, 2022, upon the proposal of the Board of Directors, it was decided not to distribute a dividend for 2021.

On 10 July 2022, Renault SA set up a liquidity contract.

5.2.4.2.2. Accounting policies

Renault S.A. has drawn up its annual financial statements in accordance with the provisions of regulations 2014-03 of the ANC (Autorité des Normes Comptables), approved by the ministerial decision of September 8, 2014 concerning the French chart of accounts.

The following methods were applied in valuing balance sheet and income statement items:

● the going concern principle,

● consistency of methods,

● accruals-basis accounting, and applying the general rules for preparation and presentation of annual financial statements.

The basic method used to value items recorded in the accounting records is the historical cost method.

Financial statements

A. Investments

As allowed by CNC (Conseil National de la Comptabilité) notice N°34 (July 1988), as an alternative to the standard valuation method for investments carried in the balance sheet, Renault S.A. has opted to state investments in wholly-controlled companies at equity:

● this method is applied to all companies that are fully consolidated in the Group's financial statements;

●

the shareholders’

equity of these

companies determined under the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements; as this is a valuation method, intercompany eliminations are not taken into account;

is

● in valuing a subsidiary, its holdings in companies wholly controlled by the Group are valued in the same way;

● the change during the year in the overall percentage of shareholders' equity corresponding to these interests is not an income or loss item; it is included in shareholders' equity under "Equity valuation difference". This amount cannot be distributed or used to offset losses. When it is negative, a provision for general depreciation is established as a charge against income.

Investments in companies not wholly controlled by Renault S.A. are valued at acquisition cost, less related expenses, or at their book value if this is lower. The book value takes account of the share of net assets and profitability prospects. Provisions are established when the book value of the investments is lower than the gross value.

Loans granted and receivables relating to subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at historical cost. Impairment is recognized when there is a risk that these advances will not be recovered.

B. Marketable securities

Marketable securities are valued at acquisition cost, excluding related expenses and accrued interest for bonds, or at market value if this is lower.

Treasury shares held for the purposes of free share plans and stock option plans and the liquidity contract are included in

marketable securities. These shares are covered by a provision for expenses, corresponding to the difference between the value of the shares (acquisition price or net book value at the date of reallocation) and the exercise price of the options for beneficiaries, when that exercise price is lower than the acquisition cost.

Treasury shares not allocated to a specific plan are also included in marketable securities. Impairment is recorded ifthe stock market price falls below the book value.

The fair value of securities is determined mainly by reference to market prices.

C. Receivables

Receivables are stated at nominal value. Impairment is recognizsed when their realizable value falls below historical cost, notably based on age and the risk of non- recovery.

D. Translation

of foreign currency receivables and liabilities

Receivables

and liabilities denominated in foreign

currencies are translated as follows:

05

● all receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies are converted at the year-end exchange rate;

● exchange differences arising between the date of transactions and December 31 are recorded in Other assets and Deferred income (translation adjustment);

● a provision for risk equal to the unrealised exchange losses is established after determining an overall foreign exchange position for each

currency (including derivatives).

Unrealized losses affecting Nissan hedge are no longer covered by provisions in the income statement. Under regulation ANC 2015-05, no provisions are recorded in the income statement for unrealized losses on the hedging instrument until the hedged cash flows are realized (date of liquidation or sale of the investment).

E. Redeemable shares

Redeemable shares are recorded in a separate line of shareholders’ equity at nominal value with no subsequent revaluation.

F. Loans and financial debts

Loans are stated at their nominal amount. Loan costs, including issuance expenses, and bond redemption premiums, which are recorded in Other Assets, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the corresponding duration.

G. Provisions for risks and liabilities

Provisions

for risks and

liabilities

are defined accordance with

in

ANC regulation 2014-03. They are established for probable payment obligations existing at the year-end. A contingent liability, in contrast, is an obligation that is neither probable nor definite at the date the financial statements are established, or a probable obligation that cannot be reliably estimated. Provisions are not established for contingent liabilities, but an off- balance sheet commitment is reported where relevant.

H. Derivatives

Changes in the value of hedging derivatives are not recognized in the balance sheet unless partial or total recognition of such changes is relevant to ensure symmetrical treatment to the hedged item .

This symmetrical treatment would involve revaluation of the hedging instrument in a transition account, with a corresponding entry in a Cash Instrument account, in parallel to the translation adjustments booked on the hedged item.

Foreign exchange gains and losses on loans set up for the Nissan hedge have no longer been included in profit and loss since the application of ANC regulation 2015-05 form 1 January 2017. They are recorded in specific accounts under receivables or other the liabilities other and accumulated amounts will be transferred to the income statement at the date of liquidation or sale of the investment.

In March 2021, Renault SA sold its involvement in Daimler AG for a sum of €1 143 million. The disposal of the shares, with a historical value of €584 million, resulted in an exceptional profit of €558 million.

There are no extraordinary operations in 2022.

5.2.4.2.7. Income tax

As Renault S.A. elected to determine French income taxes under the domestic tax consolidation regime when it was formed, this regime has applied to the group in which Renault S.A. is taxed in France since January 1, 2004. French subsidiaries that are more than 95% owned by Renault S.A. pay their income taxes directly to the company under this regime. Each entity included in the domestic tax consolidation records its theoretical taxes as if it was taxed separately. The tax saving generated by this system is treated as income for Renault S.A., the company heading the group of entities concerned. The Renault tax group, applying the principle of neutrality, Renault S.A. is not obliged to reallocate or reimburse the subsidiaries for the tax savings resulting from utilization of their tax losses.

The maximum allowable amount of losses carried forward against taxable income is €1 million plus 50% of the taxable income above that amount. The balance can be carried forward indefinitely.

These rules are applicable:

● for determining the income/loss of the tax consolidation group;

● by convention, for determining the income/loss of each company included in the tax consolidation serving as a base for their calculation of income tax.

These rules on tax loss carryforwards apply to all losses existing at the year-end, whatever their origin.

In practice, Renault S.A. has not charged deficits for the determination of its 2022 taxable income which amounts to -€1 835 million.

In 2022, the tax consolation group waived the reduced rate on industrial royalties as permitted by article 39 terdecies ofthe CGI.

The income generated by income taxes in 2022 was €132 million, corresponding to the income tax paid by the subsidiaries of Renault S.A.,

including

any

tax

adjustments, as if they were taxed separately.

In 1999, Renault S.A. acquired an investment in Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. At December 31, 2022, this investment comprised 1,831,837,027 shares or 43.40% of the capital of Nissan. These shares are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and have a nominal value of Y50. At December 31, 2022, their stock market price was Y418 (€2,97) per share, giving a total of €5 441 million (Y556 (€4,26) per share and a total of €7 804 million at December 31, 2021).

Based on the Nissan share price at December 31, 2022, 418 yen per share, the Renault Group's investment in Nissan is valued at €5,441 million (€7,804 million at December 31, 2021 based on a share price of 556 yen).

At December 31, 2022, the stock market value of the investment was 12.48% lower than the value of Nissan in Renault Group’s statement of financial position.

In application of the approach presented in the Note on accounting policies, an impairment test was carried out at December 31, 2022. An after-tax discount rate of 7.73% and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.42% were used to calculate value in use. The

terminal value was calculated under profitability assumptions consistent with Nissan’s past data and conservative medium

and long-term prospects, incorporating new medium-term forecasts for volumes and exchange rates.

The

test result did not

lead

to recognition of any impairment on the investment in Nissan at December 31, 2022 and it is considered that a reasonably possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in a recoverable value lower than the book value of the investment in Nissan.

State Guaranteed

credit facility of the Automotive

segments

In 2020, Renault Group opened a credit line with a pool of five banks, for the maximum amount of €5 billion covered by a French State guarantee for up to 90% of the amount borrowed. At December 31, 2020, €4 billion had been drawn on this credit line.

The initial maturity for each drawing was 12 months, extendable by Renault Group for a further three years, with repayment of one third each year. The interest rate on each drawing was indexed on the 12-month Euribor for the first year, then the 6-month Euribor for any extensions. If extended, these credit drawings were repayable in one- third instalments in 2023 and the

2022, 2024 on anniversary dates of the initial drawings, with the possibility of early repayment of outstanding instalments at Renault Group’s initiative.

The Group exercised the extension options on all these drawings except for the drawing maturing in August 2021, of which €1 billion was repaid.

Changes in other liabilities were as follows:

As announced on February 18, 2022, the Group made three early repayments in 2022 €340 million each, on February 7, March and

22 June 23 corresponding to the final instalments (August, September and December 2024) of the three drawings. After the three repayments made at maturity during

the second half-year, totalling €990 million, the outstanding amount of the State- guaranteed credit facility at the year-end is €990 million. The total amount will be repaid in 2023.

C. Other loans and financial debts

Other loans debts

and financial

Forward purchases and sales and swap transactions are off-balance sheet.

Foreign exchange risk:

Foreign exchange

risk management essentially comprises currency swaps and forward

exchange operations to cover Renault’s own foreign-currency financing. Renault S.A. also undertakes forward exchange operations to hedge loans and borrowings in foreign currencies with its subsidiaries.

Interest rate risk:

Renault S.A. carries most of the Group’s indebtedness. Its interest rate risk management policy applies two basic long-term use fixed-rate

principles: investments financing, and investments for liquidity reserves use floating-rate financing. The financing in yen undertaken as part ofthe hedge of Nissan equity is fixed-rate.

Renault S.A. uses derivatives to implement the above interest rate and exchange risk management policies. These operations are undertaken with Renault Finance, a fully-owned Renault Group subsidiary.

Liquidity risk:

Renault S.A. also has confirmed credit agreements with banking establishments (see note 5.2.4.2.20).

The

contractual documentation for

these financing arrangements and credit agreements contains no clause that might adversely affect credit availability as a result of a change in Renault’s credit rating or financial ratio compliance.

Given the available cash reserves, confirmed credit lines unused at the year-end, and the prospects for renewal of short-term financing, Renault S.A. has sufficient financial resources to cover its commitments over a 12-month horizon.

As part of the management of RCI Banque’s major risk ratio, Renault S.A. entered into a pledging agreement in 2010 for a deposit of €700 million by Renault S.A. with RCI Banque.

Contingent liabilities

Group companies are periodically subject

to tax inspections in the countries in which they operate. Accepted tax adjustments are recorded as provisions in the financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful. Tax

liabilities are recognized via provisions when

there are

uncertainties over

the determination oftaxes.

On 19 December 2021, Renault S.A. received a provisional notification of a tax reassessment in respect of transfer pricing for the years 2013 to 2016. Renault Group is challenging the most significant amounts of these notifications, and no provision has been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2022 in connection with this matter.

On December 19, 2019 Renault s.a.s received notification, interrupting the limitation period, of a tax reassessment on transfer prices in 2016, and an additional notification was received on June 24, 2021 concerning the years 2017 and 2018. On December 21, 2022, the French tax authorities issued a proposed reassessment for the year 2019 relating to a further inspection covering the period 2019-2020, also interrupting the relevant limitation period. Renault Group is challenging the most significant amounts of these notifications, and no provision has been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2022 in connection with this matter.

Financial statements

Group companies are periodically subject to investigations by the authorities in the countries in which they operate. When the resulting financial consequences

05

are accepted, they are recognized in the financial statements via provisions. When they are contested, they are recognized on a case-by-case basis, based on estimates that take into account the risk that the

proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful. The

main investigations by the competition and automotive regulation authorities at in progress December 31, 2022 concern illegal agreements and the level of vehicle emissions in Europe.

In the ongoing “emissions” affair in France, in which a formal legal investigation was opened on January 12, 2017 at the request of the Paris public prosecution office, Renault s.a.s. was officially placed under investigation for deceit on June 8, 2021.

In July 2021 Renault Group paid bail of €20 million (included in the balance sheet) to guarantee its representation throughout the proceedings and to cover payment of any damages and fines. It also issued a €60 million bank guarantee on October 8, 2021 to cover compensation for any prejudice identified. Renault Group denies having committed any offence. All Renault Group vehicles are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

The potential consequences of the next steps in these ongoing proceedings cannot be reliably estimated, and no provision was recognized in connection with this matter at December 31, 2022 (nor at December 31, 2021).

5.2.4.2.26. Five-years financial highlights

(1) Provisions are those recorded during the year, less reversals and applications.

(2) Based on the average number of shares at year end

(3) No employees.

5.2.4.2.27. Subsequent events

Nissan Motor CO Ltd and Renault Group have decided to rebalance the Alliance with a 15% cross-shareholding, with a retention obligation, as well as an obligation to cap their holdings. They will both be able to freely exercise the voting rights attached to their 15% direct shareholding, with a 15% cap.

Renault Group will transfer 28.4% of its Nissan shares into a French trust, where voting rights would be "neutralised" for most decisions, but where economic rights (dividends and proceeds from the sale of the shares) will still fully benefit Renault Group until the sale ofthose shares.

Renault Group will instruct the trustee to sell these Nissan shares if the economic conditions are reasonable for Renault Group, in an organised and orderly process, but it has no obligation to sell its shares within a specific predetermined timeframe.

The Alliance Operating Board will remain the coordinating body.

This decision has no impact on the valuation of Nissan Motor CO Ltd shares in the Renault S.A. balance sheet at the close of December 31, 2022.

6.1.2.2. Annual General Meetings

Annual General Meetings are convened in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions. The right to attend Annual General Meetings is evidenced by the registration of the shares in an account in the name of the shareholder or in the name of the registered intermediary acting on his/her behalf, by midnight (zero hours) Paris time on the second working day before the Annual General Meeting, either in the registered share account held by the Company or in the bearer share accounts held by an authorized intermediary. The registration of bearer shares in the share records held by the authorized intermediary is evidenced by a shareholding certificate issued by this intermediary.

6.1.2.3. Shares and voting rights

Shares are registered in an account according to the provisions and terms established by law. Fully paid-up shares are in either registered or bearer form, at the discretion of their owner. However, shares that are not fully paid-up must be in registered form.

Each shareholder has as many votes as he or she owns shares, subject to the provisions below.

Since April 3, 2016, pursuant to Article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial Code, as amended by Law No. 2014-384 of March 29, 2014 (the Florange Law), unless provided otherwise in Renault S.A.’s Bylaws adopted subsequently to the promulgation of the Florange Law, a voting right double to that conferred to other shares is automatically attributed to all fully paid-up shares for which proof of registration is provided for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder.

As of December 31, 2022, 104,899,372 Renault shares held double voting rights, representing around 35.5 % of the share capital and around 68.4 % of the voting rights that may be exercised in Renault’s Annual General Meeting.

The double voting right automatically ceases for any share that has been converted to a bearer share or that has undergone a transfer of ownership, subject to any exceptions provided for by law.

Shares resulting from the capital increase, earnings or other paid-in capital are entitled to double voting rights from their date of issue if they are attributed on account of shares already enjoying such rights.

In addition, treasury shares do not carry voting rights.

At December 31, 2022, the theoretical number of voting rights was 400,621,656.

In view of the treasury shares (5,310,961) and the shares held by Nissan Finance Co., Ltd. (44,358,343, see chapter 6.2.6.1 below), all of which are non-voting shares, the total number of exercisable voting rights was 306,705,509 as of December 31, 2022.

6.1.2.4. Identifiable bearer shares

The Company is authorized to make use the appropriate legal provisions for identifying shareholders having immediate or future voting rights in its own Shareholders’ General Meetings.

6.1.2.5. Shareholding disclosures

In addition to the legal requirement for shareholders to inform the Company if they hold certain percentages of its share capital or voting rights, every shareholder or fund management company that comes into possession of a number of shares above 2% of the share capital or voting rights, or a multiple of this percentage representing less than or equal to 5% of the share capital or voting rights, shall inform the Company of the total number of shares held. Such disclosure shall be made by registered letter with return receipt within four (4) business days starting from the date of registration of the shares that brought the shareholder’s interest up to or beyond the threshold. Beyond 5%, the aforementioned disclosure requirement applies to fractions of share capital or voting rights of 1%.

For the purposes of determining the thresholds described above, indirectly held shares or equity equivalents held as defined by the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 and L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code will also be taken into account.

The declarer must certify that this declaration includes all shares held or owned as per the provisions of the preceding paragraph and must indicate the acquisition date(s). The disclosure requirement applies in the same manner if the holding of shares falls below any of the aforementioned thresholds, 2% or 1% as applicable.

If the conditions described above are not complied with, any shares exceeding the fraction that should have been declared shall be deprived of its voting rights at any Shareholders’ General Meetings held in a period of two years following the date of due notification, in so far as

this is requested at the meeting by one or more shareholders who together hold at least 1% of share capital.

Threshold crossings in 2022

In 2022, the Company received declarations for the crossing of the legal threshold of 5% of the voting rights, alternately upwards and downwards, from Bank of America, acting on behalf of clients and funds under its management. Bank of America’s most recent notification, dated September 1, 2022, indicated that it held 1.07% of the Company’s share capital and 0.79% of its voting rights.

6.2.5 Potential share capital

6.2.5.1. Options

The Company has decided to no longer grant any new stock-option plans.

The latest authorization was adopted by the Combined General Meeting of April 29, 2011, for a period of 38 months. There are no plans to request a new authorization from the Annual General Meeting.

6.2.5.2. Performance shares

Pursuant to Article L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code, the Combined General Meeting of May 25, 2022, authorized, for a period of 38 months, the Board of Directors to grant performance shares, either existing or to be issued, to employees of the Company or to certain categories of such employees and employees of the companies and groupings related to it, as provided for in Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code. For details regarding grants and shares in circulation, refer to table in chapter 3.2.5.4 of this Universal Registration Document.

6.2.5.3. Share buyback1

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-209-2 of the French Commercial Code, the seventeenth resolution of the Combined General

Meeting of

May

25, 2022, authorized the Company to trade in its own shares for a maximum of 18 months.

The objectives of the program are to:

i. cancel all or some of the acquired shares, notably to compensate for the dilution arising from the acquisition of performance shares;

ii. use all or some of the acquired shares to implement any performance share allocation plan or any other shareholding plan for former and current employees and senior executives of the Company and its Group;

iii. deliver all or part of the shares acquired on the exercise of rights attached to securities giving right to the allocation of shares in the Company;

iv. stimulate the secondary market or the liquidity of the Renault share through a liquidity contract; and

v. generally, perform

more all other transactions currently allowed or that would become authorized or allowed by applicable laws or by the AMF.

Tradings carried out by Renault on its own shares during of the 2022 financial year

1. Stimulation of the secondary market or the liquidity of the Renault shares (liquidity contract)

Renault Group

entrusted

Exane

BNP Paribas

with implementing a liquidity and market surveillance contract for its common stock for a period of one year, with tacit renewal, starting on July 1st, 2022.

In 2022, under this liquidity contract, Renault Group acquired 4,124,809 shares at an average stock price of €30.63 for a total of €126,348,890 and sold 4,013,309 shares at an average stock price of €30.73 for a total of €123,325,558.

On January 25, 2023, in compliance with the applicable laws, the Company published the half-year report on the liquidity contract as of December 31, 2022, which is also available on its website: www.renaultgroup.com

2. Coverage of employee share allocations

Renault bought back 1,260,000 shares in June 2022 and 636,000 shares in November 2022 as part of its share buyback program approved by the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022.

The 5,199,461 shares held directly or indirectly by Renault as of December 31, 2022 (excluding the liquidity contract) are allocated in their entirety to the coverage of free performance share plans or any other form of allocation, allotment or transfer granted to employees or senior executives of the Company. The shares acquired by the beneficiaries of share-based compensation (Long-Term Incentives) must not have any effect on the share capital structure. Shares acquired under a free performance share allocation will thus come from the share buyback program. The aim is to leave the Company’s share capital unchanged.

1 This paragraph includes information that must be given in the description of the program pursuant to Article 241-2 of the AMF General Regulation and information required in compliance with the provisions of Article L. 225-211 of the French Commercial Code.

Description ofthe share buyback program submitted for authorization to the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2023

Pursuant to Articles 241-1 to 241-7 of the French Financial Market Authority (AMF) General Regulation and Article L. 451-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, this section describes the objectives and arrangements for the new treasury share buyback program organized by Renault, which will be submitted for approval to the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders of May 11, 2023.

The objectives of the program are to:

i. cancel all or some of the shares acquired, notably to compensate for dilution arising from the exercise of share subscription options or the acquisition of shares allocated free of charge, subject to the approval of sixteenth resolution submitted to this Annual General Meeting;

ii. use all or some of the shares acquired to implement any stock option plan or free share plan, or any other form of assignment, allocation, disposal or transfer to former or current employees and corporate officers of the Company and its Group, and complete any hedging transaction relating to any such transactions, within the terms set by law;

iii. deliver any or all of the shares acquired upon exercise of rights attached to securities giving right, through conversion, exercise, redemption or exchange or any other manner, to shares of the Company, pursuant to applicable regulations;

iv. act on the secondary market or the liquidity of the Renault share through an independent Investment Services Provider pursuant to a liquidity agreement complying with the AMF-approved market practices; and

v. more generally, perform all

other transactions currently allowed or that would become authorized or allowed by applicable laws or regulatory provisions or by the AMF.

542

The acquisition, disposal, transfer or exchange of these shares may be performed by any means, notably on the market or

through

over-the-counter transactions,

including block trading, using derivative financial instruments or bonds or securities granting access to the Company’s share capital, or by implementing option strategies, within the bounds of applicable regulations.

The Annual General Meeting sets:

● the maximum purchase price (or the counter-value of this amount on the same date in any other currency), excluding acquisition costs, at €100 per share, and the maximum amount of funds allocated for the completion of the share purchase program at €957.25 million, it being specified that in the event of transactions affecting the share capital (splitting or consolidation of shares or bonus share allocations to shareholders), the price and the maximum amount of funds allocated for the completion of the share purchase program will be adjusted on the basis of a multiplying factor equal to the ratio of the number of securities constituting the share capital prior to the transaction compared with the total number after the transaction;

● the number of shares that may be acquired at 10% of the shares constituting the share capital, it being specified that (a) this limit applies to a given amount of the Company’s share capital, to be adjusted if necessary to take into account transactions affecting the share capital subsequent to this Annual General Meeting and (b) if the aim of the share buyback is to enhance share liquidity pursuant to the conditions set out in the AMF General Regulations, the number of shares taken into account to calculate the 10% limit corresponds to the number of shares purchased, minus the number of shares resold during the authorization period.

Within the limits allowed by the applicable regulations, transactions performed by the Board of Directors pursuant to this authorization may take place at any time during the validity of the share buyback program, it being specified that if a public bid for the Company’s stocks is made by a third party, the Board of Directors may not implement this authorization, and the Company may not pursue any share purchase program until after the end of the bid period, except in the case of prior authorization by the Annual General Meeting.

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code, the Company may not own more than 10% of the total of its own shares, or more than 10% of any given share category, either directly or through any person acting in their own name on behalf of the Company.

All powers are granted to the Board of Directors, including powers of sub-delegation, to implement this authorization, specify, if necessary, its terms, decide on its conditions and, in particular, place all orders on or off the stock market, assign or reassign the shares acquired to the different

purposes pursued in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory conditions, perform all formalities, and, more generally, do all that is required in this respect.

(1) Forinformation on the change in the voting rights held by the French State, see the explanations in the following paragraphs.

(2) The Mercedes-Benz group (formerly Daimler) sold its entire stake in Renault (3.10% of the capital) on November 15, 2021.

(3) The portion of shares held by employees taken into account in this category corresponds to shares held by current and former employees in the FCPE mutual funds, as well as to registered shares directly held by the employee beneficiaries of performance share allocation as from the 2016 allocation plan, pursuant to Article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code.

(4) Including shares held underthe liquidity contract implemented by the Company since 1 July 2022.

The share capital amounts to €1,126,701,902.04 divided into 295,722,284 shares. At December 31, 2022, this was distributed as follows:

●

the French State held 15.01% of the share capital corresponding to 22.16% of theoretical voting rights and 28.94% of exercisable voting rights in Renault (excluding the application of the restrictions described in chapter 6.2.6.2 of the Universal registration document);

● the Nissan group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Nissan Finance Co., Ltd., held 15.00% of Renault’s share capital (unchanged compared with December 31, 2021). However, Nissan Finance Co., Ltd. is not entitled to exercise the voting rights attached to these shares pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 233–31 of the French Commercial Code, owing to Renault’s ownership interest in Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., parent company of Nissan Finance Co., Ltd;

● Renault’s employees and former employees own 3.79% of the share capital, including 2.92% via FCPE mutual funds under collective management and 0.87% by beneficiaries of performance share

employee

allocations since the 2016 plan;

● treasury stock represented 1.80% of the share capital. Under French law, such shares do not carry voting rights;

● the free float represented 64.40% of the share capital (compared with 64.83% at December 31, 2021); and

● the members of the Board of Directors together and directly hold less than 0.5% of the Company’s share capital.

To the best of the Company’s knowledge, aside from The Capital Group

Companies, Inc. (5.05%), no other shareholder holds more than 5% of the capital or voting rights, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert, other than the French State or Nissan Finance Co., Ltd.

A survey of Renault SA shareholders was conducted as of December 31, 2022.

This survey gave an estimated breakdown of the public ownership’s interest by category of major shareholder. At that date:

● the institutional shareholders owned 48.99% of Renault’s share capital, it being stated that:

● French institutional investors held 11.04% of the share capital;

● foreign institutional investors held 37.95% of the share capital; and

● the 10 largest French and foreign institutional investors held approximately 21.62% of the share capital.

● the remaining public ownership in the capital i.e. 15.41% was held primarily by individual shareholders.

6.2.6.2. Shareholder agreements on shares and voting rights of the Company

To the best knowledge of the Company, and as at the date of this Universal Registration Document, there are no shareholder agreement governing relations between the Company’s shareholders and no concerted actions.

Restrictions on the free exercise of voting rights attached to shares held by the French State

In the context of the discussions conducted, on the one hand, between Renault and Nissan and on the other between Renault and the French State, to restore the balance between the investments of these two shareholders in Renault, and on this occasion, to ensure the continuity and development of the Alliance, on February 4, 2016, Renault and the French State entered into a governance agreement aimed at restricting the free exercise of the French State’s voting rights in respect of certain decisions submitted to Renault’s Annual General Meeting.

This limitation varies depending on the quorum reached atthe Annual General Meeting:

● if the shareholders attending or represented at the Annual General Meeting in question own maximum 70% of the shares with voting rights (either single or double voting rights), the French State’s freely exercisable voting rights are capped at 17.9% of the exercisable voting rights; and

● if the shareholders attending or represented at the Annual General Meeting in question own more than 70% of the shares with voting rights (either single or double voting rights), the French State’s freely exercisable voting rights are capped at 20% of the exercisable voting rights.

Beyond this applicable capping threshold, the French State’s voting rights are exercised in a neutral way, i.e.:

● at 50% in favor, and 50% against, the adoption of ordinary resolutions;

● at 66⅔% in favor, and 33⅓% against, the adoption of extraordinary resolutions; and

●

in full for

the adoption of resolutions

requiring

shareholder unanimity.

544 Renault Group I Universalregistration document 2022

The French State’s neutralized voting rights do not have an impact on the outcome of the vote for resolutions subject to capping, unlike voting rights that are freely exercisable by the French State and the other shareholders.

The restriction on the free exercise of the French State’s voting rights applies to

all decisions within the competence of the Ordinary General Meeting, with the exception of the following decisions, for which the French State may freely exercise all of its double voting rights:

● appropriation of income, fixing of the dividend and its payout date;

● the option of receiving all or part of the dividend payout in cash or in shares;

● appointment of directors representing the French State, renewal of their terms of office or ratification of their appointments by the Board of Directors;

● removal of directors representing the French State;

● approval of the sale of significant assets; related-party agreements

● representatives of the French State voted on the Board of Directors; and

against which

the

● grant of delegation to the Board of Directors to trade in Renault’s shares, in the event of a program to buy back one or more blocks of shares from one or more identified shareholders.

For Extraordinary General Meetings, the French State may freely exercise all of its voting rights, with the exception of the following decisions for which the French State’s freely exercisable voting rights are capped, namely

● grant or renewal of delegations of authority or powers to the management bodies of Renault whose terms are consistent with the existing practices of Renault as demonstrated the over five years preceding the decision;

● decision or delegation granted to the Board of Directors to award stock options, allocate performance shares or issue shares or securities giving access to the capital to the employees and company officers of the Group; ● modification of the age limit for the exercise of functions or the term of office of directors and senior executive officers; and

● transfer of the head office (except outside of France).

In addition,the restriction is suspended:

In the event of violation by the French State of its commitments under the corporate governance agreement, Renault may seek conversion into bearer shares of all Renault shares owned by the French State, thus depriving them of the double voting rights for a period of two years.

Uptevia (previously, BNP Paribas Securities Services), the custodian for Renault’s shares, assists Renault Group in

the implementation of this mechanism through the management of the seven fully registered shareholder accounts in which the Renault shares held by the French State are registered. The terms of its involvement are set out in an agreement for the implementation of the governance agreement, which was signed on February 4, 2016, between Renault, the French State and BNP Paribas Securities Services.

6.3.3.1. Dividend policy

During the presentation of the “Revolution” phase of the Renaulution strategic plan on November 8, 2022, Renault Group announced the reinstatement of a dividend payment from 2023 (for 2022 FY – subject to the Shareholders’ General Meeting approval). This dividend symbolizes a new era. The payout ratio will increase gradually and in a disciplined manner up to 35% of net income - Group share, in the mid-term. To do so, the Group

must achieve its first priority: return to an investment grade rating.

At its meeting of February 15, 2023, the Board of Directors proposed the payment of a €0.25 dividend for 2022, a proposal that will be submitted to the vote of the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2023. The dividend would be paid fully in cash with the ex-dividend date scheduled on May 17, 2023 and the payment date on May 19, 2023.

Dividends are paid out at the dates and places specified either by the Annual General Meeting or, failing that, by the Board of Directors

(1) The Board of Directors of Renault, at its meeting of February 13, 2020, had proposed the payment of a dividend of €1.10 per share for the 2019 financial year. In the context linked to the coronavirus pandemic around the world in 2020 and in a spirit of responsibility towards all of the Group’s stakeholders who made efforts or experienced the effects of an unprecedented crisis, , the Board of Directors of Renault decided, at its meeting of April 9, 2020, to no longer propose the payment of a dividend, which was approved by the Annual General Meeting of June 19, 2020 (3rd resolution).

(2) On February 18, 2021, Renault's Board of Directors decided not to propose the distribution of a dividend, which was approved by the General Meeting of April 23, 2021 (3rd resolution).

APA: Average Performing Assets correspond to the average performing loans, financial lease and assets arising from operating lease transactions. Average calculated on end of month figures for customer segment and on daily data on dealer financing

AVES: Alliance Vehicle Evaluation System: a system of quality checks conducted on new vehicles as they come off the assembly lines. AVES applies a detailed method comprising a static/visual component and a dynamic componentto detect defects.

Avtovaz: Russian company, manufacturer of the Lada brand in which Renault has a controlling interest, via a joint venture, fully consolidated in Renault’s financial statements since the end of 2016.

B

BOM: Board of Management, which was in charge of the company's strategic orientations and decisions, was replaced by the Leadership Team on February 1, 2023.

C

CAFE: Corporate Average Fuel Economy, which represents the average level of fuel consumption or CO2 emissions for all passenger vehicles sold by a carmaker.

CCT: Cross-Company Team, a team comprised of Renault and Nissan representatives who, as part of the Alliance, explore synergy possibilities for the two companies.

CET1: (Common Equity Tier 1) this ratio is a regulatory indicator of banks' financial soundness, derived from Basel 3. It makes it possible to measure performance in terms of capital consumption.

CKD (Completely Knocked Down): Supply chain principle whereby basic bodywork components and sets of assembly parts are shipped unassembled to faraway plants. The shell is then assembled in the body shop, paint shop and trim & chassis shop.

CMF: Common Module Family, a sharing principle, via a series of shared platforms of the Alliance, based on a modular system of architecture that enables a wide range of vehicles to be built from a smaller pool of parts, creating higher added value for the Group’s customers.

CVT: Continuously Variable Transmission. A gearbox technology that enables the vehicle to run at optimum power. A CVT delivers better fuel economy than a conventional automatic transmission.

It provides a

smoother,

more comfortable driving experience by

D

DKD (Dismantled Knocked Down): Supply chain principle whereby vehicles are assembled in-plant and then partially disassembled for shipping (front and rear frames, cylinder block and other parts according to customs duties).

Downsizing: reduction of engine capacity. Optimizing combustion-powered engines remains one of the most economical ways of limiting fuel consumption and, as such, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Downsizing involves reducing the capacity of the engines – and thus fuel consumption and CO2 emissions – while maintaining performance.

E

EBA: Emergency Brake Assist. A system that detects emergency braking

situations and instantaneously increases braking pressure to shorten the distance the vehicle takes to stop.

Equity is the amount shown in the Group’s financial statement.

Euro NCAP: safety standards for crash tests.

Euro NCAP conducts crash tests to provide consumers with accurate information on the safety performances of their cars. Since 2009, Euro NCAP has given an overall rating to each vehicle tested with assessments of “Adult occupant protection”, “Child protection”, “Pedestrian protection” and “Safety assist”. Euro NCAP publishes information about ESC fitment and the results of rear impact (whiplash) tests in terms of seat design.

Euro 5 and Euro 6: the Euro 5 emission standards are part of the Euro emission standards, which set the maximum pollutant emission limits, excluding CO2, for cars and other vehicles. The Euro 5 emission standard came into effect in September 2009 for new car certifications and covers all new cars since January 2011. In 2014, Euro 6, which focuses mainly on NOx emissions, took its place.

F

FC: fuel cell. Consisting of a nucleus and a single electron, hydrogen is the simplest and lightest of the elements. It is 14 times lighter than air. In a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen are brought into contact on either side of a polymer electrolyte

membrane. They combine to produce water, the only “emission” of the engine, which generates electricity and heat. It is this electrical energy that powers the vehicle’s electric engine.

Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by a company after interest payments, net tax and

investments. FCF is used to:

● reduce the Net Financial Debt of Automotive;

● pay dividends;

● buy back the company’s own shares and minority interests;

● carry out external growth operations:

acquire

companies or holdings in associated companies.

The FCF indicator for the automotive sectors is an indicator defined and calculated based on accounting data in the cash flow statement. However, this indicator is neither defined nor required in IFRS.

The Group has chosen to calculate this indicator on the basis of the Automotive segments, excluding all items from the sales financing segment, with the exception of dividends paid and capital increases in sales financing.

Free cash flow is therefore obtained from the items in the statement of cash flows of the automotive sectors by adding the following items:

Cash flow (excluding dividends received from listed companies and including dividends received from sales finance)

+ change in the working capital requirement

+ physical and intangible investments net of disposals

+ change in capitalized leased assets (vehicles and batteries)

– subscription to Sales Financing capital increases

= operationalfree cash flow ofthe automotive sectors

FTT: Functional Task Team: a team made up of Renault and Nissan representatives who, within the framework of the Alliance, provide their respective expertise on management processes, standards and tools.

with the business lines concerned, an overall policy and ambitious progress objectives concerning safety and working conditions, ergonomics, industrial hygiene and the environment.

Hyvia: In June 2021, Renault Group and Plug Power signed an agreement to create a joint venture dedicated to hydrogen mobility. The company Hyvia will offer a complete ecosystem of turnkey solutions, including light commercial vehicles with fuel cells, and charging stations.

K

KPI: Key Performance Indicators. KPIs are used to measure the Company’s performance. They provide an overview of the Group’s performance, which is reported monthly to the GEC. KPIs are the main tool for performance management in each geographical region or business line.

L

LAB: the accident analysis, biomechanics and human behavior laboratory known as the desire to improve road safety, drawing on a number of scientific disciplines where physics and human sciences converge. Accident analysis and research into driver behavior probe the causes and consequences of road accidents with a view to

improving prevention. Biomechanics endeavors to increase protection for vehicle occupants.

Leadership Team: The Leadership Team is in charge of the company's strategic orientations and decisions. Replaces the BOM (Board of Management) on February 1, 2023.

M

Materiality matrix: the materiality matrix is a tool which enables prioritization of extra-financial stakes with strategic reach. By conducting a materiality analysis, the Company works on the subjects that have a (potentially) extensive and significant impact on its business model, and translate

then these (as far as possible) into indicators. The methodology used must be comprehensible, reproducible and transparent.

N

NEDC: The New European Driving Cycle is a standardized driving cycle and test procedure used to measure the emission levels and fuel economy of all types of vehicles in Europe. The NEDC is thus an objective criterion for assessing the performance of models by different manufacturers. The vehicle is put on a roller bench and driven three times through the same urban cycle (ECE–15), followed by one “extra-urban” cycle. The average of the four cycles is the average fuel economy.
